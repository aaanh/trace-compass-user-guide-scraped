### Renaming a Trace or Experiment

Traces and Experiment can be renamed from theProject Explorerview. To rename a trace or experiment select the relevant trace and click the right mouse button. Then selectRename...from the context sensitive menu. The trace or experiment needs to be closed in order to do this operation.



A new dialog box will show for entering a new name. Enter a new trace or experiment name respectively in the relevant text field and click onOK. If the new name already exists the dialog box will show an error and a different name has to be entered.





After successful renaming the new name will show in theProject Explorer. In case of a trace all reference links to that trace will be updated too. Note that linked traces only changes the display name, the underlying trace resource will stay the original name.

Note that all supplementary files will be also handled accordingly (see alsoDeleting Supplementary Files).

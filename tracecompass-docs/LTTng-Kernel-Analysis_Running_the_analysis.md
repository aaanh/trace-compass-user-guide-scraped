### Running the analysis

To open all three traces simultaneously, we first create an experiment containing these traces and then synchronize the traces, such that they have a common time base. Then, the analysis is done by selecting a task in theControl Flow View. The result is displayed in theCritical Flow View, which works like theControl Flow View. The steps to load the Django example follows.
- Download and extract theDjango tracearchive.
- In TraceCompass, open theLTTng Kernel Perspective.
- Create a new tracing project. SelectFile -> New -> Tracing -> Tracing Project, choose a name and clickFinish.
- Under the created tracing project, right-click onTracesand selectImport.... In the import dialog, select the root directory containing the extracted trace by clicking onBrowse. Three traces should be listed. Select the traces and clickFinish. After the import is completed, the traces should be listed belowTraces.
- Right-click onExperiments, selectNew...and enter a name for the experiment, such asdjango.
- Right-click on thedjangoexperiment and click onSelect Traces.... In the dialog, check the three tracesdjango-client,django-httpdanddjango-db. These traces will appear below the experiment. If the experiment is opened at this stage, the traces are not synchronized and there will be a large time gap between events from different traces.
- To synchronize the traces, right-click on thedjangoexperiment and selectSynchronize Traces. In theSelect reference tracedialog, select any available trace and clickFinish. Once the synchronization is completed, a new entry with an underline suffix will appear for each modified trace. The created trace entries have a function which is applied to the timestamps of events in order to shift the time according to the reference trace. TheProject Explorerafter the import is shown below.
- Open the experimentdjango. TheControl Flowand theResourcesviews should display the three traces simultaneously.
- In the main menu, selectWindow -> Show View -> Other...and underLTTngselectCritical Flow View. The view is empty for the moment.
- In theCritical Flow View, right-click on theProcessentry to analyze and selectFollow, as shown in the figure below.The analysis will execute and the result will appear in theCritical Flow View. For the Django example, use theView Filtersto search for the python process with TID 2327. When zooming on the execution, the view displays the work done by the Web server and the database to process the request of the python client. Vertical arrows represent synchronization and communication between processes. The legenddisplays the colors associated with the processes states.

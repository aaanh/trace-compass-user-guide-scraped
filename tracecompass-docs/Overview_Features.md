## Features

Trace Compass has a number of features to allow efficient handling of very large traces (and sets of large traces):
- Support for arbitrarily large traces (larger than available memory)
- Support for correlating multiple time-ordered traces
- Support for zooming down to the nanosecond on any part of a trace or set of traces
- Views synchronization of currently selected time or time range, and window time range
- Efficient searching and filtering of events
- Support for trace bookmarks
- Support for importing and exporting trace packages
- Support for arbitrarily large traces (larger than available memory)
- Support for correlating multiple time-ordered traces
- Support for zooming down to the nanosecond on any part of a trace or set of traces
- Views synchronization of currently selected time or time range, and window time range
- Efficient searching and filtering of events
- Support for trace bookmarks
- Support for importing and exporting trace packages

There is also support for the integration of non-LTTng trace types:
- Built-in CTF parser
- Dynamic creation of customized parsers (for XML and text traces)
- Dynamic creation of customized state systems (from XML files)
- Dynamic creation of customized views (from XML files)
- Built-in CTF parser
- Dynamic creation of customized parsers (for XML and text traces)
- Dynamic creation of customized state systems (from XML files)
- Dynamic creation of customized views (from XML files)

Trace Compass provides the following main views:
- Project Explorer- an extension to the standard Eclipse Project view tailored for tracing projects
- Events- a versatile view that presents the raw events in tabular format with support for searching, filtering and bookmarking
- Statistics- a view that that provides simple statistics on event occurrences by type
- Histogram- a view that displays the event density with respect to time in traces

- Statistics- a view that that provides simple statistics on event occurrences by type
- Histogram- a view that displays the event density with respect to time in traces

These views can be extended or tailored for specific trace types (e.g. kernel, HW, user app).

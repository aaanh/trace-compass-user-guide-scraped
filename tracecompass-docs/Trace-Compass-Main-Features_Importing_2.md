#### Importing

TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces for a tracing project. To import a trace package to theTracesfolder, one can open theImport...menu from theFilemain menu. Then selectTrace Package Import.



One can also open the wizard by expanding the project name, right-clicking on a target folder under theTracesfolder then selectingImport Trace Package...menu item in the context-sensitive menu.



At this point, theTrace Package Import Wizardis opened.



TheFrom archive filefield is used to specify the location of the trace package to export. The user can choose the content to import in the tree.

If the wizard was opened using the File menu, the destination project has to be selected in theInto projectfield.

When Finish is clicked, the trace is imported in the target folder. The folder structure from the trace package is restored in the target folder.

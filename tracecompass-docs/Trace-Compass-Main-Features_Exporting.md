#### Exporting

TheExport Trace Package Wizardallows users to select a trace and export its files and bookmarks to an archive on a media.

TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. To export traces contained in theTracesfolder, one can open theExport...menu from theFilemain menu. Then selectTrace Package Export



At this point, theTrace Package Exportis opened. The project containing the traces has to be selected first then the traces to be exported.



One can also open the wizard and skip the first page by expanding the project, selecting traces or trace folders under theTracesfolder, then right-clicking and selecting theExport Trace Package...menu item in the context-sensitive menu.



Next, the user can choose the content to export and various format options for the resulting file.



TheTraceitem is always selected and represents the files that constitute the trace. TheSupplementary filesitems represent files that are typically generated when a trace is opened by the viewer. Sharing these files can speed up opening a trace dramatically but also increases the size of the exported archive file. TheSizecolumn can help to decide whether or not to include these files. Lastly, by selectingBookmarks, the user can export all the bookmarks so that they can be shared along with the trace.

TheTo archive filefield is used to specify the location where to save the resulting archive.

TheOptionssection allows the user to choose between a tar archive or a zip archive. Compression can also be toggled on or off.

When Finish button is clicked, the package is generated and saved to the media. The folder structure of the selected traces relative to theTracesfolder is preserved in the trace package.

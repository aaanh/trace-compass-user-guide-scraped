## Pin and Clone

Some views, such as time graph and XY chart views, can be opened multiple times in order to show content from different traces and/or window ranges simultaneously. This can be done by using theNew <view name> viewsub-menu in the view'sView Menuat the far right of the tool bar.

By default, a view shows content from the active trace, which is the last trace whose events editor tab has been selected.

When a view is pinned, it no longer follows the active trace and is locked to the trace to which it is pinned. The view's tab will show the pinned trace's name within brackets, e.g. View Name <trace name>.

A view can be pinned to the current active trace by clicking thePin Viewbuttonon the tool bar, or pinned to any specific opened trace by using thePin Viewbutton's drop-down menu. This drop-down menu can also be used to switch the pinned trace of a pinned view. Once a view is pinned, it can be unpinned by clicking theUnpin Viewbuttonon the tool bar.

### Selecting Traces for an Experiment

After creating an experiment, traces need to be added to the experiment. To select traces for an experiment select the newly create experiment and click the right mouse button. SelectSelect Traces...from the context sensitive menu.



A new dialog box will open with a list of available traces. The filter text box can be used to quickly find traces. Use buttonsSelect AllorDeselect Allto select or deselect all traces. Select the traces to add from the list and then click onFinishor you can go a step further by activating the time range filtering option. Enter the time range using the following format: 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS SSS SSS' and click onFinish. By using this option, only traces, among your selected trace, that are in or overlap the range will be added to the experiment.



Now the selected traces will be linked to the experiment and will be shown under theExperimentsfolder. Expanding of theViewsfolder will show all available analysis that are defined either for the experiment or for contained traces.  If there are multiple traces of the same trace type the "Views" folder will aggregate all available analysis that are the same to one entry in the tree. Each analysis output (view) can be opened from the experiment context.



Alternatively, traces can be added to an experiment usingDrag and Drop.

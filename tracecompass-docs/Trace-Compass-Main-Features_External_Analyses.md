## External Analyses

Trace Compass supports the execution ofexternal analysesconforming to theLAMI 1.0.x specification. This includes recent versions of theLTTng-Analyses project.

An external analysis is aprogram executed by Trace Compass. When the program is done analyzing, Trace Compass generates areportcontaining its results. A report contains one or more tables which can also be viewed as bar and scattercharts.

Note: The program to execute is found by searching the directories listed in the standard$PATHenvironment variable when no path separator (/on Unix and OS X,\on Windows) is found in its command.

Trace Compass ships with a default list ofdescriptorsof external analyses (not the analyses themselves), including the descriptors of theLTTng analyses. If the LTTng analyses project is installed, its analyses are available when opening or importing an LTTng kernel trace.

### Running an External Analysis

To run an external analysis:
- Import a trace to the project.
- Make sure the trace is opened by double-clicking its name in theProject Explorer View.
- Under the trace in theProject Explorer View, expandExternal Analysesto view the list of available external analyses.The external analyses which are either missing or not compatible with the trace are stroke and cannot be executed.

The external analyses which are either missing or not compatible with the trace are stroke and cannot be executed.


- Optional: If you want the external analysis to analyze a specific time range of the current trace, make a time range selection.You can use views like theHistogram Viewand theControl Flow View(if it's available for this trace) to make a time range selection.External analyses are executed on the current time range selection if there is one, or on the whole trace otherwise.

You can use views like theHistogram Viewand theControl Flow View(if it's available for this trace) to make a time range selection.

- Right-click the external analysis to run and clickRun External Analysis.


- In the openedExternal Analysis Parameterswindow, optionally enter extra parameters to pass to the program.


- ClickOKto start the analysis.
- Import a trace to the project.
- Make sure the trace is opened by double-clicking its name in theProject Explorer View.

- Right-click the external analysis to run and clickRun External Analysis.




- In the openedExternal Analysis Parameterswindow, optionally enter extra parameters to pass to the program.




- ClickOKto start the analysis.

Note that many external analyses can be started concurrently.

When the external analysis is done analyzing, its results are saved as areportin Trace Compass. The tables contained in this report are also automatically opened into a new report view when the analysis is finished.

### Opening a Report

To open a report:
- UnderReportsunder a trace in theProject Explorer View, double-click the report to open.Each result table generated by the external analysis is shown in its own tab in the opened report view.

### Creating a Chart from a Result Table

To create a bar or a scatter chart from the data of a given result table:
- Open the reportcontaining the result table to use for creating the chart.
- In the opened report view, click the tab of the result table to use for creating the chart.
- Click theView Menubutton, then click eitherNew custom bar chartorNew custom scatter chart.


- In the openedBar chart series creationorScatter chart series creationwindow, underSeries creator, select a column to use for the X axis of the chart, and one or more columns to use for the Y axis of the chart, then clickAddto create a series.Repeat this step to create more series.



Repeat this step to create more series.
- ClickOKto create the chart.The chart is created and shown at the right of its source result table.

### Adding and Removing a User-Defined External Analysis

You can add a user-defined external analysis to the current list of external analyses. Note that the command to invoke must conform to the machine interface ofLTTng analyses0.4.

Note: If you want to create your own external analysis, consider following theLAMI 1.0 specification, which is supported by later versions of Trace Compass.

To add a user-defined external analysis:
- Under any trace in theProject Explorer View, right-clickExternal Analysesand clickAdd External Analysis.


- In the openedAdd External Analysiswindow, enter the name of the new external analysis and the associated command to run.The name is the title of the external analysis as shown underExternal Analysesin theProject Explorer View.The command is the complete command line to execute. You can put arguments containing spaces or other special characters in double quotes.Note: If the command is not a file system path, then it must be found in the directories listed in the$PATHenvironment variable.

### Debugging the XML state provider

To debug the state system that was generated by the XML state provider, one could use theState System Explorer View, along with the events editor. By selecting an event, you can see what changes this event caused and the states of other attributes at the time.

If there are corrections to make, you may modify the XML state provider file, and re-import it. To re-run the analysis, you must first delete the supplementary files by right-clicking on your trace, and selectingDelete supplementary files.... Check your analysis' .ht file, so that the analysis will be run again when the trace is reopened. The supplementary file deletion will have closed the trace, so it needs to be opened again to use the newly imported analysis file.

If modifications are made to the XML state provider after it has been "published", theversionattribute of thexmlStateProviderelement should be updated. This avoids having to delete each trace's supplementary file manually. If the saved state system used a previous version, it will automatically be rebuilt from the XML file.

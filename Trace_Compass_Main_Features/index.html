<h2 id="project-explorer-view"><a class="header" href="#project-explorer-view">Project Explorer View</a></h2>
<p>The Project Explorer view is the standard Eclipse Project Explorer.Tracingprojects are well integrated in the Eclipse's Common Navigator Framework. The Project Explorer showsTracingproject with a small "T" decorator in the upper right of the project folder icon.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-tracing-project"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-tracing-project">Creating a Tracing Project</a></h3>
<p>A newTracingproject can be created using the New Tracing Project wizard. To create a newTracingselectFile &gt; New &gt; Project...from the main menu bar or alternatively form the context-sensitive menu (click with right mouse button in theProject Explorer.</p>
<p>The first page of project wizard will open.</p>
<p>In the list of project categories, expand categoryTracingand selectTracing Projectand the click onNext &gt;. A second page of the wizard will show. Now enter the a name in the fieldProject Name, select a location if required and the press onFinish.</p>
<p>A new project will appear in theProject Explorerview.</p>
<p>Tracing projects have two sub-folders:Traceswhich holds the individual traces, andExperimentswhich holds sets of traces that we want to correlate.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-a-project-as-tracing-project"><a class="header" href="#configuring-a-project-as-tracing-project">Configuring a Project as Tracing Project</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to configure an existing project, for example C/C++ or Java project, as a Tracing project. All Trace Compass related features will be available within the same project. To configure a project as Tracing project, right-click on the project in the Project Explorer and select menu itemConfigure &gt; Configure or convert to Tracing Project.</p>
<p>Upon successful configuration, the project tree will be updated and theTrace Compasstop-level node will be added. Expanding theTrace Compassnode will show theTracesandExperimentsnodes from the Tracing project.</p>
<h3 id="importing-traces-to-the-project"><a class="header" href="#importing-traces-to-the-project">Importing Traces to the Project</a></h3>
<p>TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. It can optionally contain a tree of trace folders to organize traces into sub-folders. The following chapters will explain different ways to import traces to theTracesfolder of a tracing project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening a Trace</li>
<li>Importing</li>
<li>Drag and Drop</li>
<li>Opening a Trace</li>
<li>Importing</li>
<li>Drag and Drop</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opening-a-trace"><a class="header" href="#opening-a-trace">Opening a Trace</a></h4>
<p>To open a trace, right-click on a target trace folder and selectOpen Trace....</p>
<p>A new dialog will show for selecting a trace to open. Select a trace file and then click onOK. Note that for traces that are directories (such as Common Trace Format (CTF) traces) any file in the trace directory can be selected to open the trace. Now, the trace viewer will attempt to detect the trace types of the selected trace. The auto detection algorithm will validate the trace against all known trace types. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. After successful validation the trace will be linked into the selected target trace folder and then opened with the detected trace type.</p>
<p>Depending of the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types can vary.</p>
<h4 id="importing"><a class="header" href="#importing">Importing</a></h4>
<p>To import a set of traces to a trace folder, right-click on the target folder and selectImport...from the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>At this point, theImport Trace Wizardwill show for selecting traces to import. By default, it shows the correct destination directory where the traces will be imported to. Now, specify the location of the traces in theRoot directory. For that click on the buttonBrowse, browse the media to the location of the traces and click onOK. Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders. If the selected files include archive files (tar, zip), they will be extracted automatically and imported as well.</p>
<p>Traces can also be imported directly from an archive file such as a zip or a tar file by selecting theSelect archive fileoption then by clickingBrowse. Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders as usual.</p>
<p>Optionally, select theTrace Typefrom the drop-down menu. IfTrace Typeis set to<Automatic Detection>, the wizard will attempt to detect the trace types of the selected files. The automatic detection algorithm validates a trace against all the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. Optionally,Import unrecognized tracescan be selected to import trace files that could not be automatically detected by<Automatic Detection>.</p>
<p>Select or deselect the checkboxes forOverwrite existing trace without warning,Create links in workspaceandPreserve folder structure. When all options are configured, click onFinish.</p>
<p>Note that traces of certain types (e.g. LTTng Kernel) are actually a composite of multiple channel traces grouped under a folder. Either the folder or its files can be selected to import the trace.</p>
<p>The optionPreserve folder structurewill create, if necessary, the structure of folders relative to (and excluding) the selectedRoot directory(orArchive file) into the target trace folder.</p>
<p>The optionCreate Experimentwill create an experiment with all imported traces. By default, the experiment name is theRoot directoryname, when importing from directory, or theArchive filename, when importing from archive. One can change the experiment name by typing a new name in the text box beside the option.</p>
<p>The optionTime Range filteringwill filter your previously selected traces using the given time range. A trace will be imported into the project only if its time range is included or overlap the provided range.</p>
<p>If a trace already exists with the same name in the target trace folder, the user can choose to rename the imported trace, overwrite the original trace or skip the trace. When rename is chosen, a number is appended to the trace name, for example smalltrace becomes smalltrace(2).</p>
<p>If one selectsRename All,Overwrite AllorSkip Allthe choice will be applied for all traces with a name conflict.</p>
<p>Upon successful importing, the traces will be stored in the target trace folder. If a trace type was associated to a trace, then the corresponding icon will be displayed. If no trace type is detected the default editor icon associated with this file type will be displayed. Linked traces will have a little arrow as decorator on the right bottom corner.</p>
<p>Depending of the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types can vary.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can open theImport...menu from theFilemain menu, then selectTracing&gt;Trace Importand click onNext &gt;.</p>
<p>At this point, theImport Trace Wizardwill show. To import traces to the tracing project, follow the instructions that were described above.</p>
<h4 id="drag-and-drop"><a class="header" href="#drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</a></h4>
<p>Traces can be also be imported to a project by dragging from another tracing project and dropping to the project's target trace folder. The trace will be copied and the trace type will be set.</p>
<p>Any resource can be dragged and dropped from a non-tracing project, and any file or folder can be dragged from an external tool, into a tracing project's trace folder. The resource will be copied or imported as a new trace and it will be attempted to detect the trace types of the imported resource. The automatic detection algorithm validates a trace against all known trace types. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. If no trace type is detected the user needs to set the trace type manually.</p>
<p>To import the trace as a link, use the platform-specific key modifier while dragging the source trace. A link will be created in the target project to the trace's location on the file system.</p>
<p>If a folder containing traces is dropped on a trace folder, the full directory structure will be copied or linked to the target trace folder. The trace type of the contained traces will not be auto-detected.</p>
<p>It is also possible to drop a trace, resource, file or folder into an existing experiment. If the item does not already exist as a trace in the project's trace folder, it will first be copied or imported, then the trace will be added to the experiment.</p>
<h3 id="trace-package-exporting-and-importing"><a class="header" href="#trace-package-exporting-and-importing">Trace Package Exporting and Importing</a></h3>
<p>A trace package is an archive file that contains the trace itself and can also contain its bookmarks and its supplementary files. Including supplementary files in the package can improve performance of opening an imported trace but at the expense of package size.</p>
<h4 id="exporting"><a class="header" href="#exporting">Exporting</a></h4>
<p>TheExport Trace Package Wizardallows users to select a trace and export its files and bookmarks to an archive on a media.</p>
<p>TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. To export traces contained in theTracesfolder, one can open theExport...menu from theFilemain menu. Then selectTrace Package Export</p>
<p>At this point, theTrace Package Exportis opened. The project containing the traces has to be selected first then the traces to be exported.</p>
<p>One can also open the wizard and skip the first page by expanding the project, selecting traces or trace folders under theTracesfolder, then right-clicking and selecting theExport Trace Package...menu item in the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>Next, the user can choose the content to export and various format options for the resulting file.</p>
<p>TheTraceitem is always selected and represents the files that constitute the trace. TheSupplementary filesitems represent files that are typically generated when a trace is opened by the viewer. Sharing these files can speed up opening a trace dramatically but also increases the size of the exported archive file. TheSizecolumn can help to decide whether or not to include these files. Lastly, by selectingBookmarks, the user can export all the bookmarks so that they can be shared along with the trace.</p>
<p>TheTo archive filefield is used to specify the location where to save the resulting archive.</p>
<p>TheOptionssection allows the user to choose between a tar archive or a zip archive. Compression can also be toggled on or off.</p>
<p>When Finish button is clicked, the package is generated and saved to the media. The folder structure of the selected traces relative to theTracesfolder is preserved in the trace package.</p>
<h4 id="importing-1"><a class="header" href="#importing-1">Importing</a></h4>
<p>TheImport Trace Package Wizardallows users to select a previously exported trace package from their media and import the content of the package in the workspace.</p>
<p>TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces for a tracing project. To import a trace package to theTracesfolder, one can open theImport...menu from theFilemain menu. Then selectTrace Package Import.</p>
<p>One can also open the wizard by expanding the project name, right-clicking on a target folder under theTracesfolder then selectingImport Trace Package...menu item in the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>At this point, theTrace Package Import Wizardis opened.</p>
<p>TheFrom archive filefield is used to specify the location of the trace package to export. The user can choose the content to import in the tree.</p>
<p>If the wizard was opened using the File menu, the destination project has to be selected in theInto projectfield.</p>
<p>When Finish is clicked, the trace is imported in the target folder. The folder structure from the trace package is restored in the target folder.</p>
<h3 id="refreshing-of-trace-and-trace-folder"><a class="header" href="#refreshing-of-trace-and-trace-folder">Refreshing of Trace and Trace Folder</a></h3>
<p>Traces and trace folders in the workspace might be updated on the media. To refresh the content, right-click the trace or trace folder and select menu itemRefresh. Alternatively, select the trace or trace folder and press keyF5.</p>
<h3 id="remote-fetching"><a class="header" href="#remote-fetching">Remote Fetching</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to import traces automatically from one or more remote hosts according to a predefined remote profile by using theFetch Remote Traceswizard.</p>
<p>To start the wizard, right-click on a target trace folder and selectFetch Remote Traces....</p>
<p>The wizard opens on theRemote Profilepage.</p>
<p>If the remote profile already exists, it can be selected in theProfile namecombo box. Otherwise, clickManage Profilesto open theRemote Profilespreferences page.</p>
<h4 id="remote-profile-elements"><a class="header" href="#remote-profile-elements">Remote Profile elements</a></h4>
<p>ClickAddto create a new remote profile. A default remote profile template appears.</p>
<h5 id="profile"><a class="header" href="#profile">Profile</a></h5>
<p>Edit theProfile namefield to give a unique name to the new profile.</p>
<p>Under the Profile element, at least one Connection Node element must be defined.</p>

<p>URI: URI for the connection. Its scheme maps to a particular Remote Services provider. If the connection name already exists for that provider, the URI must match its connection information. The schemesshcan be used for the Built-In SSH provider. The schemefilecan be used for the local file system.</p>
<p>To view or edit existing connections, see theRemote Development&gt;Remote Connectionspreferences page. On this page the user can enter a password for the connection.</p>
<p>Under the Connection Node element, at least one Trace Group element must be defined.</p>

<p>Under the Trace Group element, at least one Trace element must be defined.</p>
<h5 id="trace"><a class="header" href="#trace">Trace</a></h5>
<p>File pattern: A regular expression pattern to match against the file name of traces found under the root path. If theRecursiveoption is used, the pattern must match against the relative path of the trace, using forward-slash as a path separator. Files that do not match this pattern are ignored. If multiple Trace elements have a matching pattern, the first matching element will be used, and therefore the most specific patterns should be listed first. Following are some pattern examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>.*matches any trace in any folder</li>
<li>[^/]*.logmatches traces with .log extension in the root path folder</li>
<li>.*.logmatches traces with .log extension in any folder</li>

<h3 id="deleting-supplementary-files"><a class="header" href="#deleting-supplementary-files">Deleting Supplementary Files</a></h3>
<p>Supplementary files are by definition trace specific files that accompany a trace. These file could be temporary files, persistent indexes or any other persistent data files created by the LTTng integration in Eclipse during parsing a trace. For the LTTng 2.0 trace viewer a persistent state history of the Linux Kernel is created and is stored under the namestateHistory.ht. The statistics for all traces are stored understatistics.ht. Other state systems may appear in the same folder as more custom views are added.</p>
<p>All supplementary file are hidden from the user and are handled internally by the TMF. However, there is a possibility to delete the supplementary files so that they are recreated when opening a trace.</p>

A selection dialog will be presented to the user to define where the new trace should be written. This is where the new trace files will be written, as well as any appropriateinitial statefiles.</p>
<p>The new trace will be initially named the same as the original. The user must then free to rename the new trace. The trace can also be removed from the project and re-imported later with no loss of information.</p>
<p>Note: Since trace writing works differently for every trace type, the trimming feature has to be implemented for the target trace's type. If the option remains grayed out even if a time range is selected, it is because the given trace type does not implement the trim feature.</p>
<h2 id="events-editor"><a class="header" href="#events-editor">Events Editor</a></h2>
<p>The Events editor shows the basic trace data elements (events) in a tabular format. The editors can be dragged in the editor area so that several traces may be shown side by side. These traces are synchronized by timestamp.</p>
<p>The header displays the current trace (or experiment) name.</p>
<p>The columns of the table are defined by the fields (aspects) of the specific trace type. These are the defaults:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timestamp: the event timestamp</li>
<li>Event Type: the event type</li>
<li>Contents: the fields (or payload) of this event</li>
<li>Timestamp: the event timestamp</li>
<li>Event Type: the event type</li>
<li>Contents: the fields (or payload) of this event</li>
</ul>
<p>The first row of the table is the header row a.k.a. the Search and Filter row.</p>
<p>The highlighted event is thecurrent eventand is synchronized with the other views. If you select another event, the other views will be updated accordingly. The properties view will display a more detailed view of the selected event.</p>
<p>An event range can be selected by holding theShiftkey while clicking another event or using any of the cursor keys (Up',Down,PageUp,PageDown,Home,End). The first and last events in the selection will be used to determine the current selected time range for synchronization with the other views.</p>
<p>The Events editor can be closed, disposing a trace. When this is done, all the views displaying the information will be updated with the trace data of the next event editor tab. If all the editor tabs are closed, then the views will display their empty states.</p>
<p>Column order and size is preserved when changed. If a column is lost due to it being resized to 0 pixels, right click on the context menu and selectShow All, it will be restored to a visible size.</p>
<h3 id="searching-and-filtering"><a class="header" href="#searching-and-filtering">Searching and Filtering</a></h3>

</ul>
<p>The controls can be used to modify their respective value. After validation, the other controls and views will be synchronized and updated accordingly. To modify both selection times simultaneously, press the link iconwhich disables theSelection Endcontrol input.</p>
<p>The large (full) histogram, at the bottom, shows the event distribution over the whole trace or set of traces. It also has a smaller semi-transparent orange window, with a cross-hair, that shows the current zoom window.</p>
<p>The smaller (zoom) histogram, on top right, corresponds to the current zoom window, a sub-range of the event set. The window size can be adjusted by dragging the sash left beside the zoom window.</p>
<p>The x-axis of each histogram corresponds to the event timestamps. The axis is now the same as the other views for a better visualization of the range. The y-axis shows the maximum number of events in the corresponding histogram bars.</p>
<p>The vertical blue line(s) show the current selection time (or range). If applicable, the region in the selection range will be shaded. In addition, when a selection is performed the status line (line placed at the very left bottom corner of Trace Compass) is now updated with the cursor position, the selection time or range and the delta for a range.</p>
<p>The mouse can be used to control the histogram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click: Set a selection time</li>
<li>Left-drag: Set a selection range</li>
<li>Shift-left-click or drag: Extend or shrink the selection range</li>
<li>Left-click: Set a selection time</li>

<li>Mouse wheel up: Zoom in</li>
<li>Mouse wheel down: Zoom out</li>
<li>Mouse wheel up: Zoom in</li>
<li>Mouse wheel down: Zoom out</li>
</ul>
<p>Hovering the mouse over an histogram bar pops up an information window that displays the start/end time of the corresponding bar, as well as the number of events (and lost events) it represents. If the mouse is over the selection range, the selection span in seconds is displayed.</p>
<p>In each histogram, the following keys are handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left Arrow: Moves the current event to the previous non-empty bar</li>
<li>Right Arrow: Moves the current event to the next non-empty bar</li>
<li>Home: Sets the current time to the first non-empty bar</li>
<li>End: Sets the current time to the last non-empty histogram bar</li>

<h2 id="statistics-view"><a class="header" href="#statistics-view">Statistics View</a></h2>
<p>The Statistics View displays the various event counters that are collected when analyzing a trace. After opening a trace, the elementStatisticsis added under theTmf Statistics Analysistree element in the Project Explorer. To open the view, double-click theStatisticstree element. Alternatively, selectStatisticsunderTracingwithin theShow Viewwindow (Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...). The statistics is collected for the whole trace. This view is part of theTracing and Monitoring Framework (TMF)and is generic. It will work for any trace type extensions.</p>
<p>The view is separated in two sides. The left side of the view presents the Statistics in a table. The table shows 3 columns:LevelEvents totalandEvents in selected time range. The data is organized per trace. After parsing a trace the view will display the number of events per event type in the second column and in the third, the currently selected time range's event type distribution is shown. The cells where the number of events are printed also contain a colored bar with a number that indicates the percentage of the event count in relation to the total number of events.</p>
<p>The right side illustrates the proportion of types of events into two pie charts. The legend of each pie chart gives the representation of each color in the chart.</p>
<ul>
<li>TheGlobalpie chart displays the general proportion of the events in the trace.</li>
<li>When there is a range selection, theEvents in selectionpie chart appears next to theGlobalpie chart and displays the proportion the event in the selected range of the trace.</li>
<li>TheGlobalpie chart displays the general proportion of the events in the trace.</li>
<li>When there is a range selection, theEvents in selectionpie chart appears next to theGlobalpie chart and displays the proportion the event in the selected range of the trace.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the statistics use a state system, therefore will load very quickly once the state system is written to the disk as a supplementary file.</p>
<h2 id="colors-view"><a class="header" href="#colors-view">Colors View</a></h2>
<p>The Colors view allows the user to define a prioritized list of color settings.</p>
<p>A color setting associates a foreground and background color (used in any events table), and a tick color (used in the Time Chart view), with an event filter.</p>
<p>In an events table, any event row that matches the event filter of a color setting will be displayed with the specified foreground and background colors. If the event matches multiple filters, the color setting with the highest priority will be used.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the event tick colors in the Time Chart view. If a tick represents many events, the tick color of the highest priority matching event will be used.</p>
<p>Color settings can be inserted, deleted, reordered, imported and exported using the buttons in the Colors view toolbar. Changes to the color settings are applied immediately, and are persisted to disk.</p>
<h2 id="filters-view"><a class="header" href="#filters-view">Filters View</a></h2>
<p>The Filters view allows the user to define preset filters that can be applied to any events table.</p>
<p>The filters can be more complex than what can be achieved with the filter header row in the events table. The filter is defined in a tree node structure, where the node types can be any ofTRACETYPE,AND,OR,CONTAINS,EQUALS,MATCHESorCOMPARE. Some nodes types have restrictions on their possible children in the tree.</p>
<p>TheTRACETYPEnode filters against the trace type of the trace as defined in a plug-in extension or in a custom parser. When used, any child node will have itstypecombo box fixed and itsaspectcombo box restricted to the possible aspects of that trace type. Depending of the Trace Types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types for the filtering can vary.</p>
<p>TheANDnode applies the logicalandcondition on all of its children. All children conditions must be true for the filter to match. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition.</p>
<p>TheORnode applies the logicalorcondition on all of its children. At least one children condition must be true for the filter to match. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition.</p>
<p>TheCONTAINSnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue contains the specifiedvaluestring. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. The condition can be case sensitive or insensitive. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheEQUALSnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue equals exactly the specifiedvaluestring. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. The condition can be case sensitive or insensitive. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheMATCHESnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue matches against the specifiedregular expression. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheCOMPAREnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue compared with the specifiedvaluegives the specifiedresult. The result can be set tosmaller than,equalorgreater than. The type of comparison can be numerical, alphanumerical or based on time stamp. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>For numerical comparisons, strings prefixed by "0x", "0X" or "#" are treated as hexadecimal numbers and strings prefixed by "0" are treated as octal numbers.</p>
<p>For time stamp comparisons, strings are treated as seconds with or without fraction of seconds. This corresponds to theTTTformat in theTime Formatpreferences. The value for a selected event can be found in thePropertiesview under theTimestampproperty. The common 'Timestamp' aspect can always be used for time stamp comparisons regardless of its time format.</p>
<p>Filters can be added, deleted, imported and exported using the buttons in the Filters view toolbar. The nodes in the view can be Cut (Ctrl-X), Copied (Ctrl-C) and Pasted (Ctrl-V) by using the buttons in the toolbar or by using the key bindings. This makes it easier to quickly build new filters from existing ones. Changes to the preset filters are only applied and persisted to disk when theSave filtersbutton is pressed.</p>
<p>To apply a saved preset filter in an events table, right-click on the table and selectApply preset filter...&gt;filter name.</p>
<h2 id="time-chart-view"><a class="header" href="#time-chart-view">Time Chart View</a></h2>
<p>The Time Chart view allows the user to visualize every open trace in a common time chart. Each trace is display in its own row and ticks are display for every punctual event. As the user zooms using the mouse wheel or by right-clicking and dragging in the time scale, more detailed event data is computed from the traces. The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>Time synchronization is enabled between the time chart view and other trace viewers such as the events table.</p>
<p>Color settings defined in the Colors view can be used to change the tick color of events displayed in the Time Chart view.</p>
<p>When a search is applied in the events table, the ticks corresponding to matching events in the Time Chart view are decorated with a marker below the tick.</p>
<p>When a bookmark is applied in the events table, the ticks corresponding to the bookmarked event in the Time Chart view is decorated with a bookmark above the tick.</p>
<p>When a filter is applied in the events table, the non-matching ticks are removed from the Time Chart view.</p>
<p>The Time Chart only supports traces that are opened in an editor. The use of an editor is specified in the plug-in extension for that trace type, or is enabled by default for custom traces.</p>
<p>TheAlign Viewstoggle buttonin the view menu allows to disable and enable the automatic time axis alignment of time-based views. Disabling the alignment in the this view will disable this feature across all the views because it's a workspace preference.</p>
<h2 id="state-system-explorer-view"><a class="header" href="#state-system-explorer-view">State System Explorer View</a></h2>
<p>The State System Explorer view allows the user to inspect the state interval values of every attribute of a state system at a particular time.</p>
<p>The view shows a tree of currently selected traces and their registered state system IDs. For each state system the tree structure of attributes is displayed. The attribute name, quark, value, start and end time, and full attribute path are shown for each attribute.</p>
<p>To modify the time of attributes shown in the view, select a different current time in other views that support time synchronization (e.g. event table, histogram view). When a time range is selected, this view uses the begin time.</p>
<h2 id="external-analyses"><a class="header" href="#external-analyses">External Analyses</a></h2>
<p>Trace Compass supports the execution ofexternal analysesconforming to theLAMI 1.0.x specification. This includes recent versions of theLTTng-Analyses project.</p>
<p>An external analysis is aprogram executed by Trace Compass. When the program is done analyzing, Trace Compass generates areportcontaining its results. A report contains one or more tables which can also be viewed as bar and scattercharts.</p>
<p>Note: The program to execute is found by searching the directories listed in the standard$PATHenvironment variable when no path separator (/on Unix and OS X,\on Windows) is found in its command.</p>
<p>Trace Compass ships with a default list ofdescriptorsof external analyses (not the analyses themselves), including the descriptors of theLTTng analyses. If the LTTng analyses project is installed, its analyses are available when opening or importing an LTTng kernel trace.</p>

<p>All time-based views that show the same trace are synchronized in time to show the same window range and time selection. This also applies to the selected event(s) in theEvents Editor.</p>
<p>By default, changing the window range or time selection for one trace does not affect the window range or time selection of other opened traces.</p>
<p>To allow a specific trace to be synchronized with (and react to) the window range or time selection from other traces, check theFollow time updates from other tracestoggle option in that trace'sEvent Editorcontext menu. This does not affect whether this trace's time updates will be propagated to other traces.</p>
<p>Time synchronization will only occur if the updated window range or time selection from the other trace overlaps with the full time range of the following trace. It will occur even if the following trace is not the active trace.</p>
<p>Note that two opened instances of the same trace are never time synchronized with each other, regardless of the toggle option.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-time-axis-alignment"><a class="header" href="#automatic-time-axis-alignment">Automatic Time Axis Alignment</a></h2>
<p>Trace Compass supports automatic alignment of the time axis for time-based views. The user now can resize the time window of one view and all other open views will align to the new window size and position. The automatic alignment is optional and can be disabled and enabled using theAlign Viewsbutton of the view menu. Disabling or enabling it in one view it will disable and enable it for all view since it's a workspace wide setting.</p>

<h3 id="filtering-time-events-in-time-graph-views"><a class="header" href="#filtering-time-events-in-time-graph-views">Filtering Time Events in Time Graph Views</a></h3>
<p>Filtering time events in aTime Graph view, e.g.Control Flow VieworResources View, using theTime Event Filterdialog box. To do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select theTime Graph viewyou want to filter in</li>
<li>Press/. TheTime Event Filterdialog box will show on the bottom right corner of the view.</li>
<li>Enter the string to use as filter in the opened dialog box. The view updates its content as the user enter the string. The filter is applied and unsuccessful time events are dimmed.</li>
<li>Select theTime Graph viewyou want to filter in</li>
<li>Press/. TheTime Event Filterdialog box will show on the bottom right corner of the view.</li>
<li>Enter the string to use as filter in the opened dialog box. The view updates its content as the user enter the string. The filter is applied and unsuccessful time events are dimmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note thatRegular expressionis supported.</p>
<p>It is possible to save multiple filters. They will be all activated at the same time in the view. To save a filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>SelectTime Event Filterdialog box</li>
<li>Enter the filter string to save. The view is updated and new unsuccessful time events are dimmed.</li>
<li>With the focus on the dialog box, pressENTER. Thesaved filterwill appear at the left of the dialog box and the text in the dialog box is cleared. The view is updated and previous unsuccessful dimmed time events are removed from the view and entries that have no time events to show are removed too.</li>
<li>SelectTime Event Filterdialog box</li>
<li>Enter the filter string to save. The view is updated and new unsuccessful time events are dimmed.</li>
<li>With the focus on the dialog box, pressENTER. Thesaved filterwill appear at the left of the dialog box and the text in the dialog box is cleared. The view is updated and previous unsuccessful dimmed time events are removed from the view and entries that have no time events to show are removed too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that user can still use the dialog box to filter the remaining visible time events in the view.</p>
<p>Note that the view has a limit of 4 saved filters.</p>
<p>Note that alllinksare dimmed when a filter is applied and completely removed when there is activesaved filters.</p>
<p>To remove asaved filter, click on the remove button next to the filter.</p>
<p>The time event filtering uses its owndomain-specific language (DSL). Various logical operators are suppported:</p>
<ul>
<li>&amp;&amp;performs a logical AND operation between two filter expressions. Example:ioctl &amp;&amp; 5755</li>
<li>||performs a logical OR operation between two filter expressions. Example:ioctl || splice</li>
<li>!performs a logical NOT operation between two filter expressions. Example:!ioctl</li>
<li>&amp;&amp;performs a logical AND operation between two filter expressions. Example:ioctl &amp;&amp; 5755</li>
<li>||performs a logical OR operation between two filter expressions. Example:ioctl || splice</li>
<li>!performs a logical NOT operation between two filter expressions. Example:!ioctl</li>
</ul>
<p>Filter expressionshave the following patternfieldoperatorargumentin general. Several relational operators are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>==test whether the value of the specified field is equal to the given argument. Example:TID == 5755</li>
<li>!=test whether the value of the specified field is not equal to the given argument. Example:TID != 5755</li>
<li>matchestest whether the value of the specified field matches to the given argument. Example:TID matches 5.*5$</li>
<li>containstest whether the value of the specified field contains to the given argument. Example:TID contains 7</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>test whether the value of the specified field is greater than the given argument. Example:"SOFT IRQ" &gt; 4</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>&lt;test whether the value of the specified field is less than the given argument. Example:"SOFT IRQ" &lt; 4</li>
<li>==test whether the value of the specified field is equal to the given argument. Example:TID == 5755</li>
<li>!=test whether the value of the specified field is not equal to the given argument. Example:TID != 5755</li>
<li>matchestest whether the value of the specified field matches to the given argument. Example:TID matches 5.*5$</li>
<li>containstest whether the value of the specified field contains to the given argument. Example:TID contains 7</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>test whether the value of the specified field is greater than the given argument. Example:"SOFT IRQ" &gt; 4</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>&lt;test whether the value of the specified field is less than the given argument. Example:"SOFT IRQ" &lt; 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Filter expressionscan have the following patternfieldoperator. The available relational operators for this pattern is:</p>
<ul>
<li>presenttest whether the specified field exist. Example:TID present</li>
<li>presenttest whether the specified field exist. Example:TID present</li>
</ul>
<p>The DSL allows the possibility to realize complex filters, combining severalFilter expressionsand using parenthesis. Example:TID != 5755 &amp;&amp; (System_call contains select)</p>
<p>Note thatfieldparameter with whitespace should be specified using quotes mark. Example:"SOFT IRQ" present</p>
<h3 id="filtering-of-empty-rows-time-graph-views"><a class="header" href="#filtering-of-empty-rows-time-graph-views">Filtering of Empty Rows Time Graph Views</a></h3>
<p>Time Graph Views support filtering of empty rows using a dynamic filter. Empty rows are rows with no time events nor row markers in the current visible time range. To hide empty rows, check theHide Empty Rowstoolbar button or view menu entry. Unchecking it will show empty rows again. When changing the current visible time range, the list of visible rows will be dynamically updated.</p>
<h2 id="configurable-marker-sets"><a class="header" href="#configurable-marker-sets">Configurable Marker Sets</a></h2>
<p>Time graph views can allow the user to display periodic markers over time graphs by selecting a marker set. The marker sets are user-configurable by editing themarkers.xmlfile.</p>
<p>From the view menu, selectMarker Set&gt;Edit....  Themarkers.xmlfile will be opened in an editor. After editing the file, save the modifications, and then selectMarker Set&gt;marker set nameto activate the marker set. SelectMarker set&gt;Noneto deactivate the marker set.</p>
<h3 id="marker-set-configuration-xml-format"><a class="header" href="#marker-set-configuration-xml-format">Marker Set Configuration XML Format</a></h3>
<p>The format of themarkers.xmlfile is defined as follows:</p>
<p>The<marker>element defines a fixed-period marker at the root of the marker set. Optionally, a<marker>can have child<submarker>elements, which split each marker into a number of equal sub-markers, and/or child<segments>elements, which split each marker into segments of defined weights defined by the list of child<segment>elements. Each of these elements can recursively have their own<submarker>and<segments>child elements.</p>
<p>The element attributes are defined as follows:</p>

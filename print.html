<p>Trace Compass is a Java tool for viewing and analyzing any type of logs or traces. Its goal is to provide views, graphs, metrics, etc. to help extract useful information from traces, in a way that is more user-friendly and informative than huge text dumps.</p>
<h2 id="about-tracing"><a class="header" href="#about-tracing">About Tracing</a></h2>
<p>Tracing is a troubleshooting technique used to understand the behavior of an instrumented application by collecting information on its execution path. A tracer is the software used for tracing. Tracing can be used to troubleshoot a wide range of bugs that are otherwise extremely challenging. These include, for example, performance problems in complex parallel systems or real-time systems.</p>
<p>Tracing is similar to logging: it consists in recording events that happen in a system at selected execution locations. However, compared to logging, it is generally aimed at developers and it usually records low-level events at a high rate. Tracers can typically generate thousands of events per second. The generated traces can easily contain millions of events and have sizes from many megabytes to tens of gigabytes. Tracers must therefore be optimized to handle a lot of data while having a small impact on the system.</p>
<p>Traces may include events from the operating system kernel (IRQ handler entry/exit, system call entry/exit, scheduling activity, network activity, etc). They can also consists of application events (a.k.a UST - User Space Tracing) or a mix of the two.</p>
<p>For the maximum level of detail, tracing events may be viewed like a log file. However, trace analyzers and viewers are available to derive useful information from the raw data coupled with knowledge of the traced program. These programs must be specially designed to handle quickly the enormous amount of data a trace may contain.</p>
<p>Warning: Please be aware tracing is a powerful tool. It can extract information and make problems obvious, it can do the same with user information. The user is responsible for making sure the data provided to Trace Compass is used responsibly. Trace Compass can read whatever is provided to it. This can mean in the context of tracing certain identifiable fields e.g.: user names, IP addresses, file names, file access patterns, and web access patterns can be seen. The user needs to apply caution with the data it is providing the tool, as well as remembering to delete old data regularly and when a user requests it.</p>
<h2 id="features"><a class="header" href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<p>Trace Compass has a number of features to allow efficient handling of very large traces (and sets of large traces):</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for arbitrarily large traces (larger than available memory)</li>
<li>Support for correlating multiple time-ordered traces</li>
<li>Support for zooming down to the nanosecond on any part of a trace or set of traces</li>
<li>Views synchronization of currently selected time or time range, and window time range</li>
<li>Efficient searching and filtering of events</li>
<li>Support for trace bookmarks</li>
<li>Support for importing and exporting trace packages</li>

<li>Support for importing and exporting trace packages</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also support for the integration of non-LTTng trace types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built-in CTF parser</li>
<li>Dynamic creation of customized parsers (for XML and text traces)</li>
<li>Dynamic creation of customized state systems (from XML files)</li>
<li>Dynamic creation of customized views (from XML files)</li>
<li>Built-in CTF parser</li>
<li>Dynamic creation of customized parsers (for XML and text traces)</li>
<li>Dynamic creation of customized state systems (from XML files)</li>
<li>Dynamic creation of customized views (from XML files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trace Compass provides the following main views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Explorer- an extension to the standard Eclipse Project view tailored for tracing projects</li>
<li>Events- a versatile view that presents the raw events in tabular format with support for searching, filtering and bookmarking</li>
<li>Statistics- a view that that provides simple statistics on event occurrences by type</li>
<li>Histogram- a view that displays the event density with respect to time in traces</li>

<li>Statistics- a view that that provides simple statistics on event occurrences by type</li>
<li>Histogram- a view that displays the event density with respect to time in traces</li>
</ul>
<p>These views can be extended or tailored for specific trace types (e.g. kernel, HW, user app).</p>
<h2 id="lttng-integration"><a class="header" href="#lttng-integration">LTTng integration</a></h2>
<p>One of the main features of Trace Compass is the LTTng integration. LTTng (Linux Trace Toolkit, next generation) is a highly efficient tracing tool for Linux that can be used to track down kernel and application performance issues as well as troubleshoot problems involving multiple concurrent processes and threads. It consists of a set of kernel modules, daemons - to collect the raw tracing data - and a set of tools to control, visualize and analyze the generated data. It also provides support for user space application instrumentation.
For more information about LTTng, refer to the projectsite</p>
<p>Note: This User Guide covers the integration of the latest LTTng (up to v2.4) in Eclipse.</p>
<p>The LTTng plug-ins provide an integration for the control of the LTTng tracer as well as fetching and visualization of the traces produced. It also provides the foundation for user-defined analysis tools.</p>
<p>At present, the LTTng plug-ins support the following kernel-oriented views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control Flow- to visualize processes state transitions</li>
<li>Resources- to visualize system resources state transitions</li>
<li>CPU Usage- to visualize the usage of the processor with respect to the time in traces</li>
<li>Kernel Memory Usage- to visualize the relative usage of system memory</li>
<li>IO Usage- to visualize the usage of input/output devices</li>
<li>System Calls- presents all the system calls in a table view</li>
<li>System Call Statistics- present all the system calls statistics</li>
<li>System Call Density- to visualize the system calls displayed by duration</li>
<li>System Call vs Time- to visualize when system calls occur</li>
<li>Control Flow- to visualize processes state transitions</li>
<li>Resources- to visualize system resources state transitions</li>
<li>CPU Usage- to visualize the usage of the processor with respect to the time in traces</li>
<li>Kernel Memory Usage- to visualize the relative usage of system memory</li>
<li>IO Usage- to visualize the usage of input/output devices</li>
<li>System Calls- presents all the system calls in a table view</li>
<li>System Call Statistics- present all the system calls statistics</li>
<li>System Call Density- to visualize the system calls displayed by duration</li>
<li>System Call vs Time- to visualize when system calls occur</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the LTTng plug-ins supports the following User Space traces views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory Usage- to visualize the memory usage per thread with respect to time in the traces</li>
<li>Call Stack- to visualize the call stack's evolution over time</li>
<li>Function Duration Density- to visualize function calls displayed by duration</li>
<li>Flame Graph- to visualize why the CPU is busy</li>
<li>Memory Usage- to visualize the memory usage per thread with respect to time in the traces</li>
<li>Call Stack- to visualize the call stack's evolution over time</li>
<li>Function Duration Density- to visualize function calls displayed by duration</li>
<li>Flame Graph- to visualize why the CPU is busy</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the LTTng plug-ins supports the following Control views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control- to control the tracer and configure the tracepoints</li>
<li>Control- to control the tracer and configure the tracepoints</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the control and fetching parts are targeted at the LTTng tracer, the underlying framework can also be used to process any trace that complies with theCommon Trace Format(CTF). CTF specifies a very efficient and compact binary trace format that is meant to be application-, architecture-, and language-agnostic.</p>

</ul>
<p>Although the control and fetching parts are targeted at the LTTng tracer, the underlying framework can also be used to process any trace that complies with theCommon Trace Format(CTF). CTF specifies a very efficient and compact binary trace format that is meant to be application-, architecture-, and language-agnostic.</p>

<h2 id="lttng-tracer"><a class="header" href="#lttng-tracer">LTTng Tracer</a></h2>
<p>While the Eclipse plug-ins can run on the standard Eclipse platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows), the LTTng tracer and its accompanying tools run on Linux.</p>
<p>The tracer and tools have been available for download in Ubuntu since 12.04. They can easily be installed with the following command:</p>
<p>For other distributions, older Ubuntu distributions, or the latest, bleeding edge LTTng tracer, please refer to theLTTng websitefor installation information.</p>
<p>Note: The LTTng tracer (and accompanying tools) is required only if you want to create your own traces (the usual case). If you intend to simply analyze existing traces then it is not necessary to install the tracer.</p>

<h2 id="lttng-control-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#lttng-control-dependencies">LTTng Control Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>The Eclipse LTTng Control feature controls the LTTng tracer through ansshconnection, if the tracer is running locally it can use or bypass thesshconnection.</p>
<p>When usingssh, the target system (where the tracer runs) needs to run ansshserver as well assftpserver (for file transfer) to which you have permission to connect.</p>
<p>On the host side (where Eclipse is running), you also need to have Eclipse Remote Services installed to handle the SSH connection and transport. The Remote Services are installed for you as a dependency of the LTTng Control feature. If necessary, it can be installed manually with the standard way (Help&gt;Install New Software...&gt;General Purpose Tools&gt;Remote Services).</p>
<h2 id="installation-verification"><a class="header" href="#installation-verification">Installation Verification</a></h2>
<p>If you do not have any traces, sample LTTng traces can be found herehttp://lttng.org/files/samples. This page contains links to some sample LTTng 2.0 kernel traces. The trace needs to be uncompressed to be opened. The traces can also be imported directly as archive, see theImportingsection for more detail.</p>

<p>The Eclipse LTTng Control feature controls the LTTng tracer through ansshconnection, if the tracer is running locally it can use or bypass thesshconnection.</p>
<p>When usingssh, the target system (where the tracer runs) needs to run ansshserver as well assftpserver (for file transfer) to which you have permission to connect.</p>
<p>On the host side (where Eclipse is running), you also need to have Eclipse Remote Services installed to handle the SSH connection and transport. The Remote Services are installed for you as a dependency of the LTTng Control feature. If necessary, it can be installed manually with the standard way (Help&gt;Install New Software...&gt;General Purpose Tools&gt;Remote Services).</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="opening-a-trace"><a class="header" href="#opening-a-trace">Opening a Trace</a></h4>
<p>To open a trace, right-click on a target trace folder and selectOpen Trace....</p>
<p>A new dialog will show for selecting a trace to open. Select a trace file and then click onOK. Note that for traces that are directories (such as Common Trace Format (CTF) traces) any file in the trace directory can be selected to open the trace. Now, the trace viewer will attempt to detect the trace types of the selected trace. The auto detection algorithm will validate the trace against all known trace types. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. After successful validation the trace will be linked into the selected target trace folder and then opened with the detected trace type.</p>
<p>Depending of the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types can vary.</p>
<h4 id="importing"><a class="header" href="#importing">Importing</a></h4>
<p>To import a set of traces to a trace folder, right-click on the target folder and selectImport...from the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>At this point, theImport Trace Wizardwill show for selecting traces to import. By default, it shows the correct destination directory where the traces will be imported to. Now, specify the location of the traces in theRoot directory. For that click on the buttonBrowse, browse the media to the location of the traces and click onOK. Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders. If the selected files include archive files (tar, zip), they will be extracted automatically and imported as well.</p>
<p>Traces can also be imported directly from an archive file such as a zip or a tar file by selecting theSelect archive fileoption then by clickingBrowse. Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders as usual.</p>
<p>Optionally, select theTrace Typefrom the drop-down menu. IfTrace Typeis set to<Automatic Detection>, the wizard will attempt to detect the trace types of the selected files. The automatic detection algorithm validates a trace against all the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. Optionally,Import unrecognized tracescan be selected to import trace files that could not be automatically detected by<Automatic Detection>.</p>
<p>Select or deselect the checkboxes forOverwrite existing trace without warning,Create links in workspaceandPreserve folder structure. When all options are configured, click onFinish.</p>
<p>Note that traces of certain types (e.g. LTTng Kernel) are actually a composite of multiple channel traces grouped under a folder. Either the folder or its files can be selected to import the trace.</p>
<p>The optionPreserve folder structurewill create, if necessary, the structure of folders relative to (and excluding) the selectedRoot directory(orArchive file) into the target trace folder.</p>
<p>The optionCreate Experimentwill create an experiment with all imported traces. By default, the experiment name is theRoot directoryname, when importing from directory, or theArchive filename, when importing from archive. One can change the experiment name by typing a new name in the text box beside the option.</p>
<p>The optionTime Range filteringwill filter your previously selected traces using the given time range. A trace will be imported into the project only if its time range is included or overlap the provided range.</p>
<p>If a trace already exists with the same name in the target trace folder, the user can choose to rename the imported trace, overwrite the original trace or skip the trace. When rename is chosen, a number is appended to the trace name, for example smalltrace becomes smalltrace(2).</p>
<p>If one selectsRename All,Overwrite AllorSkip Allthe choice will be applied for all traces with a name conflict.</p>
<p>Upon successful importing, the traces will be stored in the target trace folder. If a trace type was associated to a trace, then the corresponding icon will be displayed. If no trace type is detected the default editor icon associated with this file type will be displayed. Linked traces will have a little arrow as decorator on the right bottom corner.</p>
<p>Depending of the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types can vary.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can open theImport...menu from theFilemain menu, then selectTracing&gt;Trace Importand click onNext &gt;.</p>
<p>At this point, theImport Trace Wizardwill show. To import traces to the tracing project, follow the instructions that were described above.</p>
<h4 id="drag-and-drop"><a class="header" href="#drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</a></h4>
<p>Traces can be also be imported to a project by dragging from another tracing project and dropping to the project's target trace folder. The trace will be copied and the trace type will be set.</p>
<p>Any resource can be dragged and dropped from a non-tracing project, and any file or folder can be dragged from an external tool, into a tracing project's trace folder. The resource will be copied or imported as a new trace and it will be attempted to detect the trace types of the imported resource. The automatic detection algorithm validates a trace against all known trace types. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. If no trace type is detected the user needs to set the trace type manually.</p>
<p>To import the trace as a link, use the platform-specific key modifier while dragging the source trace. A link will be created in the target project to the trace's location on the file system.</p>
<p>If a folder containing traces is dropped on a trace folder, the full directory structure will be copied or linked to the target trace folder. The trace type of the contained traces will not be auto-detected.</p>
<p>It is also possible to drop a trace, resource, file or folder into an existing experiment. If the item does not already exist as a trace in the project's trace folder, it will first be copied or imported, then the trace will be added to the experiment.</p>
<h3 id="trace-package-exporting-and-importing"><a class="header" href="#trace-package-exporting-and-importing">Trace Package Exporting and Importing</a></h3>
<p>A trace package is an archive file that contains the trace itself and can also contain its bookmarks and its supplementary files. Including supplementary files in the package can improve performance of opening an imported trace but at the expense of package size.</p>
<h4 id="exporting"><a class="header" href="#exporting">Exporting</a></h4>
<p>TheExport Trace Package Wizardallows users to select a trace and export its files and bookmarks to an archive on a media.</p>
<p>TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. To export traces contained in theTracesfolder, one can open theExport...menu from theFilemain menu. Then selectTrace Package Export</p>
<p>At this point, theTrace Package Exportis opened. The project containing the traces has to be selected first then the traces to be exported.</p>
<p>One can also open the wizard and skip the first page by expanding the project, selecting traces or trace folders under theTracesfolder, then right-clicking and selecting theExport Trace Package...menu item in the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>Next, the user can choose the content to export and various format options for the resulting file.</p>
<p>TheTraceitem is always selected and represents the files that constitute the trace. TheSupplementary filesitems represent files that are typically generated when a trace is opened by the viewer. Sharing these files can speed up opening a trace dramatically but also increases the size of the exported archive file. TheSizecolumn can help to decide whether or not to include these files. Lastly, by selectingBookmarks, the user can export all the bookmarks so that they can be shared along with the trace.</p>
<p>TheTo archive filefield is used to specify the location where to save the resulting archive.</p>
<p>TheOptionssection allows the user to choose between a tar archive or a zip archive. Compression can also be toggled on or off.</p>
<p>When Finish button is clicked, the package is generated and saved to the media. The folder structure of the selected traces relative to theTracesfolder is preserved in the trace package.</p>
<h4 id="importing-1"><a class="header" href="#importing-1">Importing</a></h4>
<p>TheImport Trace Package Wizardallows users to select a previously exported trace package from their media and import the content of the package in the workspace.</p>
<p>TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces for a tracing project. To import a trace package to theTracesfolder, one can open theImport...menu from theFilemain menu. Then selectTrace Package Import.</p>
<p>One can also open the wizard by expanding the project name, right-clicking on a target folder under theTracesfolder then selectingImport Trace Package...menu item in the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>At this point, theTrace Package Import Wizardis opened.</p>
<p>TheFrom archive filefield is used to specify the location of the trace package to export. The user can choose the content to import in the tree.</p>
<p>If the wizard was opened using the File menu, the destination project has to be selected in theInto projectfield.</p>
<p>When Finish is clicked, the trace is imported in the target folder. The folder structure from the trace package is restored in the target folder.</p>
<h3 id="refreshing-of-trace-and-trace-folder"><a class="header" href="#refreshing-of-trace-and-trace-folder">Refreshing of Trace and Trace Folder</a></h3>
<p>Traces and trace folders in the workspace might be updated on the media. To refresh the content, right-click the trace or trace folder and select menu itemRefresh. Alternatively, select the trace or trace folder and press keyF5.</p>
<h3 id="remote-fetching"><a class="header" href="#remote-fetching">Remote Fetching</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to import traces automatically from one or more remote hosts according to a predefined remote profile by using theFetch Remote Traceswizard.</p>
<p>To start the wizard, right-click on a target trace folder and selectFetch Remote Traces....</p>
<p>The wizard opens on theRemote Profilepage.</p>

<p>Under the Profile element, at least one Connection Node element must be defined.</p>
<h5 id="connection-node"><a class="header" href="#connection-node">Connection Node</a></h5>
<p>Node name: Unique name for the connection within the scope of the Remote Services provider.</p>
<p>URI: URI for the connection. Its scheme maps to a particular Remote Services provider. If the connection name already exists for that provider, the URI must match its connection information. The schemesshcan be used for the Built-In SSH provider. The schemefilecan be used for the local file system.</p>
<p>To view or edit existing connections, see theRemote Development&gt;Remote Connectionspreferences page. On this page the user can enter a password for the connection.</p>
<p>Under the Connection Node element, at least one Trace Group element must be defined.</p>

<p>Under the Trace Group element, at least one Trace element must be defined.</p>
<h5 id="trace"><a class="header" href="#trace">Trace</a></h5>
<p>File pattern: A regular expression pattern to match against the file name of traces found under the root path. If theRecursiveoption is used, the pattern must match against the relative path of the trace, using forward-slash as a path separator. Files that do not match this pattern are ignored. If multiple Trace elements have a matching pattern, the first matching element will be used, and therefore the most specific patterns should be listed first. Following are some pattern examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>.*matches any trace in any folder</li>
<li>[^/]*.logmatches traces with .log extension in the root path folder</li>
<li>.*.logmatches traces with .log extension in any folder</li>

<li>folder-[^/]<em>/[^/]</em>.logmatches traces with .log extension in folders matching a pattern</li>
<li>(.*/)?filenamematches traces with a specific name in any folder</li>
</ul>
<p>Trace Type: The trace type to assign to the traces after fetching, or<Automatic Detection>to determine the trace type automatically. Note that traces whose trace type can not be assigned according to this setting are not deleted after fetching.</p>

<p>Now the selected traces will be linked to the experiment and will be shown under theExperimentsfolder. Expanding of theViewsfolder will show all available analysis that are defined either for the experiment or for contained traces.  If there are multiple traces of the same trace type the "Views" folder will aggregate all available analysis that are the same to one entry in the tree. Each analysis output (view) can be opened from the experiment context.</p>
<p>Alternatively, traces can be added to an experiment usingDrag and Drop.</p>

<h3 id="deleting-supplementary-files"><a class="header" href="#deleting-supplementary-files">Deleting Supplementary Files</a></h3>
<p>Supplementary files are by definition trace specific files that accompany a trace. These file could be temporary files, persistent indexes or any other persistent data files created by the LTTng integration in Eclipse during parsing a trace. For the LTTng 2.0 trace viewer a persistent state history of the Linux Kernel is created and is stored under the namestateHistory.ht. The statistics for all traces are stored understatistics.ht. Other state systems may appear in the same folder as more custom views are added.</p>
<p>All supplementary file are hidden from the user and are handled internally by the TMF. However, there is a possibility to delete the supplementary files so that they are recreated when opening a trace.</p>
<p>To delete all supplementary files from one or many traces and experiments, select the relevant traces and experiments in theProject Explorerview and click the right mouse button. Then select theDelete Supplementary Files...menu item from the context-sensitive menu.</p>

<p>If a time range (not a single timestamp) is selected in any of the time-based views, right clicking on the trace or experiment element in theProject Explorerwill showExport Time Selection as New Trace. This option allowstrimmingthe current trace to a subset of its events, while preserving all the states that may have been computed by various analyses using events present before the exported time range.</p>
<p>TheExporting Time Selection as New Traceoption will create a new trace and import it into the current tracing project. A selection dialog will be presented to the user to define where the new trace should be written. This is where the new trace files will be written, as well as any appropriateinitial statefiles.</p>
<p>The new trace will be initially named the same as the original. The user must then free to rename the new trace. The trace can also be removed from the project and re-imported later with no loss of information.</p>
<p>Note: Since trace writing works differently for every trace type, the trimming feature has to be implemented for the target trace's type. If the option remains grayed out even if a time range is selected, it is because the given trace type does not implement the trim feature.</p>
<h2 id="events-editor"><a class="header" href="#events-editor">Events Editor</a></h2>
<p>The Events editor shows the basic trace data elements (events) in a tabular format. The editors can be dragged in the editor area so that several traces may be shown side by side. These traces are synchronized by timestamp.</p>
<p>The header displays the current trace (or experiment) name.</p>
<p>The columns of the table are defined by the fields (aspects) of the specific trace type. These are the defaults:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timestamp: the event timestamp</li>
<li>Event Type: the event type</li>
<li>Contents: the fields (or payload) of this event</li>
<li>Timestamp: the event timestamp</li>
<li>Event Type: the event type</li>
<li>Contents: the fields (or payload) of this event</li>
</ul>
<p>The first row of the table is the header row a.k.a. the Search and Filter row.</p>
<p>The highlighted event is thecurrent eventand is synchronized with the other views. If you select another event, the other views will be updated accordingly. The properties view will display a more detailed view of the selected event.</p>
<p>An event range can be selected by holding theShiftkey while clicking another event or using any of the cursor keys (Up',Down,PageUp,PageDown,Home,End). The first and last events in the selection will be used to determine the current selected time range for synchronization with the other views.</p>
<p>The Events editor can be closed, disposing a trace. When this is done, all the views displaying the information will be updated with the trace data of the next event editor tab. If all the editor tabs are closed, then the views will display their empty states.</p>
<p>Column order and size is preserved when changed. If a column is lost due to it being resized to 0 pixels, right click on the context menu and selectShow All, it will be restored to a visible size.</p>
<h3 id="searching-and-filtering"><a class="header" href="#searching-and-filtering">Searching and Filtering</a></h3>
<p>Searching and filtering of events in the table can be performed by entering matching conditions in one or multiple columns in the header row (the first row below the column header).</p>
<p>To apply a matching condition to a specific column, click on the column's header row cell, type in aregular expression. You can also enter a simple text string and it will be automatically be replaced with a 'contains' regular expression.</p>
<p>Press theEnterkey to apply the condition as a search condition. It will be added to any existing search conditions.</p>
<p>Press theCtrl+Enterkey to immediately add the condition (and any other existing search conditions) as a filter instead.</p>
<p>When matching conditions are applied to two or more columns, all conditions must be met for the event to match (i.e. 'and' behavior).</p>
<p>A preset filter created in theFiltersview can also be applied by right-clicking on the table and selectingApply preset filter...&gt;filter name</p>
<h4 id="searching"><a class="header" href="#searching">Searching</a></h4>
<p>When a searching condition is applied to the header row, the table will select the next matching event starting from the top currently displayed event. Wrapping will occur if there is no match until the end of the trace.</p>
<p>All matching events will have a 'search match' icon in their left margin. Non-matching events will be dimmed. The characters in each column which match the regular expression will be highlighted.</p>
<p>Pressing theEnterkey will search and select the next matching event. Pressing theShift+Enterkey will search and select the previous matching event. Wrapping will occur in both directions.</p>
<p>PressEscto cancel an ongoing search.</p>
<p>To add the currently applied search condition(s) as filter(s), click theAdd as Filterbutton in the header row margin, or press theCtrl+Enterkey.</p>

<h4 id="filtering"><a class="header" href="#filtering">Filtering</a></h4>
<p>When a new filter is applied, the table will clear all events and fill itself with matching events as they are found from the beginning of the trace. The characters in each column which match the regular expression will be highlighted.</p>
<p>A status row will be displayed before and after the matching events, dynamically showing how many matching events were found and how many events were processed so far. Once the filtering is completed, the status row icon in the left margin will change from a 'stop' to a 'filter' icon.</p>
<p>PressEscto stop an ongoing filtering. In this case the status row icon will remain as a 'stop' icon to indicate that not all events were processed.</p>
<p>The header bar will be displayed above the table and will show a label for each applied filter. Clicking on a label will highlight the matching strings in the events that correspond to this filter condition. Pressing theDeletekey will clear this highlighting.</p>
<p>To remove a specific filter, click on theicon on its label in the header bar. The table will be updated with the events matching the remaining filters.</p>
<p>The header bar can be collapsed and expanded by clicking on theicons in the top-left corner or on its background. In collapsed mode, a minimized version of the filter labels will be shown that can also be used to highlight or remove the corresponding filter.</p>
<p>Right-click on the table and selectClear Filtersfrom the context menu to remove all filters. All trace events will be now shown in the table. Note that the currently selected event will remain selected even after the filters are removed.</p>
<p>You can also search on the subset of filtered events by entering a search condition in the header row while a filter is applied. Searching and filtering conditions are independent of each other.</p>
<h4 id="bookmarking"><a class="header" href="#bookmarking">Bookmarking</a></h4>
<p>Any event of interest can be tagged with a bookmark.</p>

<p>The text of selected events can be copied to the clipboard by right-clicking on the table and selectingCopy to Clipboardin the context menu. The clipboard contents will be prefixed by the column header names. For every event in the table selection, the column text will be copied to the clipboard. The column text will be tab-separated. Hidden columns will not be included in the clipboard contents.</p>
<h3 id="event-source-lookup"><a class="header" href="#event-source-lookup">Event Source Lookup</a></h3>
<p>Some trace types can optionally embed information in the trace to indicate the source of a trace event. This is accessed through the event context menu by right-clicking on an event in the table.</p>
<h4 id="source-code"><a class="header" href="#source-code">Source Code</a></h4>
<p>If a source file is available in the trace for the selected event, the itemOpen Source Codeis shown in the context menu. Selecting this menu item will attempt to find the source file in all opened projects in the workspace. If multiple candidates exist, a selection dialog will be shown to the user. The selected source file will be opened, at the correct line, in its default language editor. If no candidate is found, an error dialog is shown displaying the source code information.</p>

<h3 id="collapsing-of-repetitive-events"><a class="header" href="#collapsing-of-repetitive-events">Collapsing of Repetitive Events</a></h3>
<p>The implementation for collapsing of repetitive events is trace type specific and is only available for certain trace types. For example, a trace type could allow collapsing of consecutive events that have the same event content but not the same timestamp. If a trace type supports this feature then it is possible to select theCollapse Eventsmenu item after pressing the right mouse button in the table.</p>
<p>When the collapsing of events is executing, the table will clear all events and fill itself with all relevant events. If the collapse condition is met, the first column of the table will show the number of times this event was repeated consecutively.</p>
<p>A status row will be displayed before and after the events, dynamically showing how many non-collapsed events were found and how many events were processed so far. Once the collapsing is completed, the status row icon in the left margin will change from a 'stop' to a 'filter' icon.</p>
<p>To remove the collapse filter, press the () icon on theCollapselabel in the header bar, or press the right mouse button in the table and select menu itemClear Filtersin the context sensitive menu (this will also remove any other filters).</p>

<h2 id="histogram-view"><a class="header" href="#histogram-view">Histogram View</a></h2>
<p>The Histogram View displays the trace events distribution with respect to time. When streaming a trace, this view is dynamically updated as the events are received. The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>TheAlign Viewstoggle buttonin the view menu allows to disable and enable the automatic time axis alignment of time-based views. Disabling the alignment in the Histogram view will disable this feature across all the views because it's a workspace preference.</p>
<p>TheHide Lost Eventstoggle buttonin the local toolbar allows to hide the bars of lost events. When the button is selected it can be toggled again to show the lost events.</p>
<p>TheActivate Trace Coloringtoggle buttonin the local toolbar allows to use separate colors for each trace of an experiment. Note that this feature is not available if your experiment contains more than twenty two traces. When activated, a legend is displayed at the bottom on the histogram view.</p>
<p>On the top left, there are three text controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection Start: Displays the start time of the current selection</li>
<li>Selection End: Displays the end time of the current selection</li>
<li>Window Span: Displays the current zoom window size in seconds</li>
<li>Selection Start: Displays the start time of the current selection</li>
<li>Selection End: Displays the end time of the current selection</li>
<li>Window Span: Displays the current zoom window size in seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>The controls can be used to modify their respective value. After validation, the other controls and views will be synchronized and updated accordingly. To modify both selection times simultaneously, press the link iconwhich disables theSelection Endcontrol input.</p>
<p>The large (full) histogram, at the bottom, shows the event distribution over the whole trace or set of traces. It also has a smaller semi-transparent orange window, with a cross-hair, that shows the current zoom window.</p>
<p>The smaller (zoom) histogram, on top right, corresponds to the current zoom window, a sub-range of the event set. The window size can be adjusted by dragging the sash left beside the zoom window.</p>
<p>The x-axis of each histogram corresponds to the event timestamps. The axis is now the same as the other views for a better visualization of the range. The y-axis shows the maximum number of events in the corresponding histogram bars.</p>
<p>The vertical blue line(s) show the current selection time (or range). If applicable, the region in the selection range will be shaded. In addition, when a selection is performed the status line (line placed at the very left bottom corner of Trace Compass) is now updated with the cursor position, the selection time or range and the delta for a range.</p>
<p>The mouse can be used to control the histogram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click: Set a selection time</li>
<li>Left-drag: Set a selection range</li>
<li>Shift-left-click or drag: Extend or shrink the selection range</li>
<li>Left-click: Set a selection time</li>

<li>Mouse wheel up: Zoom in</li>
<li>Mouse wheel down: Zoom out</li>
<li>Mouse wheel up: Zoom in</li>
<li>Mouse wheel down: Zoom out</li>
</ul>
<p>Hovering the mouse over an histogram bar pops up an information window that displays the start/end time of the corresponding bar, as well as the number of events (and lost events) it represents. If the mouse is over the selection range, the selection span in seconds is displayed.</p>
<p>In each histogram, the following keys are handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left Arrow: Moves the current event to the previous non-empty bar</li>
<li>Right Arrow: Moves the current event to the next non-empty bar</li>
<li>Home: Sets the current time to the first non-empty bar</li>
<li>End: Sets the current time to the last non-empty histogram bar</li>
<li>Plus (+): Zoom in</li>
<li>Minus (-): Zoom out</li>
<li>Left Arrow: Moves the current event to the previous non-empty bar</li>
<li>Right Arrow: Moves the current event to the next non-empty bar</li>
<li>Home: Sets the current time to the first non-empty bar</li>
<li>End: Sets the current time to the last non-empty histogram bar</li>
<li>Plus (+): Zoom in</li>
<li>Minus (-): Zoom out</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="statistics-view"><a class="header" href="#statistics-view">Statistics View</a></h2>
<p>The Statistics View displays the various event counters that are collected when analyzing a trace. After opening a trace, the elementStatisticsis added under theTmf Statistics Analysistree element in the Project Explorer. To open the view, double-click theStatisticstree element. Alternatively, selectStatisticsunderTracingwithin theShow Viewwindow (Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...). The statistics is collected for the whole trace. This view is part of theTracing and Monitoring Framework (TMF)and is generic. It will work for any trace type extensions.</p>
<p>The view is separated in two sides. The left side of the view presents the Statistics in a table. The table shows 3 columns:LevelEvents totalandEvents in selected time range. The data is organized per trace. After parsing a trace the view will display the number of events per event type in the second column and in the third, the currently selected time range's event type distribution is shown. The cells where the number of events are printed also contain a colored bar with a number that indicates the percentage of the event count in relation to the total number of events.</p>
<p>The right side illustrates the proportion of types of events into two pie charts. The legend of each pie chart gives the representation of each color in the chart.</p>
<ul>
<li>TheGlobalpie chart displays the general proportion of the events in the trace.</li>
<li>When there is a range selection, theEvents in selectionpie chart appears next to theGlobalpie chart and displays the proportion the event in the selected range of the trace.</li>
<li>TheGlobalpie chart displays the general proportion of the events in the trace.</li>
<li>When there is a range selection, theEvents in selectionpie chart appears next to theGlobalpie chart and displays the proportion the event in the selected range of the trace.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the statistics use a state system, therefore will load very quickly once the state system is written to the disk as a supplementary file.</p>
<h2 id="colors-view"><a class="header" href="#colors-view">Colors View</a></h2>
<p>The Colors view allows the user to define a prioritized list of color settings.</p>
<p>A color setting associates a foreground and background color (used in any events table), and a tick color (used in the Time Chart view), with an event filter.</p>
<p>In an events table, any event row that matches the event filter of a color setting will be displayed with the specified foreground and background colors. If the event matches multiple filters, the color setting with the highest priority will be used.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the event tick colors in the Time Chart view. If a tick represents many events, the tick color of the highest priority matching event will be used.</p>
<p>Color settings can be inserted, deleted, reordered, imported and exported using the buttons in the Colors view toolbar. Changes to the color settings are applied immediately, and are persisted to disk.</p>
<h2 id="filters-view"><a class="header" href="#filters-view">Filters View</a></h2>
<p>The Filters view allows the user to define preset filters that can be applied to any events table.</p>
<p>The filters can be more complex than what can be achieved with the filter header row in the events table. The filter is defined in a tree node structure, where the node types can be any ofTRACETYPE,AND,OR,CONTAINS,EQUALS,MATCHESorCOMPARE. Some nodes types have restrictions on their possible children in the tree.</p>
<p>TheTRACETYPEnode filters against the trace type of the trace as defined in a plug-in extension or in a custom parser. When used, any child node will have itstypecombo box fixed and itsaspectcombo box restricted to the possible aspects of that trace type. Depending of the Trace Types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types for the filtering can vary.</p>
<p>TheANDnode applies the logicalandcondition on all of its children. All children conditions must be true for the filter to match. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition.</p>
<p>TheORnode applies the logicalorcondition on all of its children. At least one children condition must be true for the filter to match. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition.</p>
<p>TheCONTAINSnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue contains the specifiedvaluestring. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. The condition can be case sensitive or insensitive. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheEQUALSnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue equals exactly the specifiedvaluestring. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. The condition can be case sensitive or insensitive. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheMATCHESnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue matches against the specifiedregular expression. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheCOMPAREnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue compared with the specifiedvaluegives the specifiedresult. The result can be set tosmaller than,equalorgreater than. The type of comparison can be numerical, alphanumerical or based on time stamp. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>For numerical comparisons, strings prefixed by "0x", "0X" or "#" are treated as hexadecimal numbers and strings prefixed by "0" are treated as octal numbers.</p>
<p>For time stamp comparisons, strings are treated as seconds with or without fraction of seconds. This corresponds to theTTTformat in theTime Formatpreferences. The value for a selected event can be found in thePropertiesview under theTimestampproperty. The common 'Timestamp' aspect can always be used for time stamp comparisons regardless of its time format.</p>
<p>Filters can be added, deleted, imported and exported using the buttons in the Filters view toolbar. The nodes in the view can be Cut (Ctrl-X), Copied (Ctrl-C) and Pasted (Ctrl-V) by using the buttons in the toolbar or by using the key bindings. This makes it easier to quickly build new filters from existing ones. Changes to the preset filters are only applied and persisted to disk when theSave filtersbutton is pressed.</p>
<p>To apply a saved preset filter in an events table, right-click on the table and selectApply preset filter...&gt;filter name.</p>
<h2 id="time-chart-view"><a class="header" href="#time-chart-view">Time Chart View</a></h2>
<p>The Time Chart view allows the user to visualize every open trace in a common time chart. Each trace is display in its own row and ticks are display for every punctual event. As the user zooms using the mouse wheel or by right-clicking and dragging in the time scale, more detailed event data is computed from the traces. The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>Time synchronization is enabled between the time chart view and other trace viewers such as the events table.</p>
<p>Color settings defined in the Colors view can be used to change the tick color of events displayed in the Time Chart view.</p>
<p>When a search is applied in the events table, the ticks corresponding to matching events in the Time Chart view are decorated with a marker below the tick.</p>
<p>When a bookmark is applied in the events table, the ticks corresponding to the bookmarked event in the Time Chart view is decorated with a bookmark above the tick.</p>
<p>When a filter is applied in the events table, the non-matching ticks are removed from the Time Chart view.</p>
<p>The Time Chart only supports traces that are opened in an editor. The use of an editor is specified in the plug-in extension for that trace type, or is enabled by default for custom traces.</p>
<p>TheAlign Viewstoggle buttonin the view menu allows to disable and enable the automatic time axis alignment of time-based views. Disabling the alignment in the this view will disable this feature across all the views because it's a workspace preference.</p>
<h2 id="state-system-explorer-view"><a class="header" href="#state-system-explorer-view">State System Explorer View</a></h2>
<p>The State System Explorer view allows the user to inspect the state interval values of every attribute of a state system at a particular time.</p>
<p>The view shows a tree of currently selected traces and their registered state system IDs. For each state system the tree structure of attributes is displayed. The attribute name, quark, value, start and end time, and full attribute path are shown for each attribute.</p>
<p>To modify the time of attributes shown in the view, select a different current time in other views that support time synchronization (e.g. event table, histogram view). When a time range is selected, this view uses the begin time.</p>
<h2 id="external-analyses"><a class="header" href="#external-analyses">External Analyses</a></h2>
<p>Trace Compass supports the execution ofexternal analysesconforming to theLAMI 1.0.x specification. This includes recent versions of theLTTng-Analyses project.</p>
<p>An external analysis is aprogram executed by Trace Compass. When the program is done analyzing, Trace Compass generates areportcontaining its results. A report contains one or more tables which can also be viewed as bar and scattercharts.</p>
<p>Note: The program to execute is found by searching the directories listed in the standard$PATHenvironment variable when no path separator (/on Unix and OS X,\on Windows) is found in its command.</p>
<p>Trace Compass ships with a default list ofdescriptorsof external analyses (not the analyses themselves), including the descriptors of theLTTng analyses. If the LTTng analyses project is installed, its analyses are available when opening or importing an LTTng kernel trace.</p>

<p>Important note:The custom parsers identify a log entry when the first line's regular expression matches (Root Line n). Each subsequent text line in the log is attempted to be matched against the regular expression of the parser's input lines in the order that they are defined (Line n.*). Only the first matching input line will be used to process the captured data to be stored in the log entry. When a text line matches a Root Line's regular expression, a new log entry is started.</p>

<h2 id="pin-and-clone"><a class="header" href="#pin-and-clone">Pin and Clone</a></h2>
<p>Some views, such as time graph and XY chart views, can be opened multiple times in order to show content from different traces and/or window ranges simultaneously. This can be done by using theNew <view name> viewsub-menu in the view'sView Menuat the far right of the tool bar.</p>
<p>By default, a view shows content from the active trace, which is the last trace whose events editor tab has been selected.</p>
<p>When a view is pinned, it no longer follows the active trace and is locked to the trace to which it is pinned. The view's tab will show the pinned trace's name within brackets, e.g. View Name <trace name>.</p>
<p>A view can be pinned to the current active trace by clicking thePin Viewbuttonon the tool bar, or pinned to any specific opened trace by using thePin Viewbutton's drop-down menu. This drop-down menu can also be used to switch the pinned trace of a pinned view. Once a view is pinned, it can be unpinned by clicking theUnpin Viewbuttonon the tool bar.</p>

<h2 id="time-synchronization-of-views"><a class="header" href="#time-synchronization-of-views">Time Synchronization of Views</a></h2>
<p>All time-based views that show the same trace are synchronized in time to show the same window range and time selection. This also applies to the selected event(s) in theEvents Editor.</p>
<p>By default, changing the window range or time selection for one trace does not affect the window range or time selection of other opened traces.</p>
<p>To allow a specific trace to be synchronized with (and react to) the window range or time selection from other traces, check theFollow time updates from other tracestoggle option in that trace'sEvent Editorcontext menu. This does not affect whether this trace's time updates will be propagated to other traces.</p>
<p>Time synchronization will only occur if the updated window range or time selection from the other trace overlaps with the full time range of the following trace. It will occur even if the following trace is not the active trace.</p>
<p>Note that two opened instances of the same trace are never time synchronized with each other, regardless of the toggle option.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-time-axis-alignment"><a class="header" href="#automatic-time-axis-alignment">Automatic Time Axis Alignment</a></h2>
<p>Trace Compass supports automatic alignment of the time axis for time-based views.

<h4 id="opening-a-trace-1"><a class="header" href="#opening-a-trace-1">Opening a Trace</a></h4>
<p>To open a trace, right-click on a target trace folder and selectOpen Trace....</p>
<p>A new dialog will show for selecting a trace to open. Select a trace file and then click onOK. Note that for traces that are directories (such as Common Trace Format (CTF) traces) any file in the trace directory can be selected to open the trace. Now, the trace viewer will attempt to detect the trace types of the selected trace. The auto detection algorithm will validate the trace against all known trace types. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. After successful validation the trace will be linked into the selected target trace folder and then opened with the detected trace type.</p>
<p>Depending of the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types can vary.</p>
<h4 id="importing-2"><a class="header" href="#importing-2">Importing</a></h4>
<p>To import a set of traces to a trace folder, right-click on the target folder and selectImport...from the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>At this point, theImport Trace Wizardwill show for selecting traces to import. By default, it shows the correct destination directory where the traces will be imported to. Now, specify the location of the traces in theRoot directory. For that click on the buttonBrowse, browse the media to the location of the traces and click onOK. Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders. If the selected files include archive files (tar, zip), they will be extracted automatically and imported as well.</p>
<p>Traces can also be imported directly from an archive file such as a zip or a tar file by selecting theSelect archive fileoption then by clickingBrowse. Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders as usual.</p>
<p>Optionally, select theTrace Typefrom the drop-down menu. IfTrace Typeis set to<Automatic Detection>, the wizard will attempt to detect the trace types of the selected files. The automatic detection algorithm validates a trace against all the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. Optionally,Import unrecognized tracescan be selected to import trace files that could not be automatically detected by<Automatic Detection>.</p>
<p>Select or deselect the checkboxes forOverwrite existing trace without warning,Create links in workspaceandPreserve folder structure. When all options are configured, click onFinish.</p>
<p>Note that traces of certain types (e.g. LTTng Kernel) are actually a composite of multiple channel traces grouped under a folder. Either the folder or its files can be selected to import the trace.</p>
<p>The optionPreserve folder structurewill create, if necessary, the structure of folders relative to (and excluding) the selectedRoot directory(orArchive file) into the target trace folder.</p>
<p>The optionCreate Experimentwill create an experiment with all imported traces. By default, the experiment name is theRoot directoryname, when importing from directory, or theArchive filename, when importing from archive. One can change the experiment name by typing a new name in the text box beside the option.</p>
<p>The optionTime Range filteringwill filter your previously selected traces using the given time range. A trace will be imported into the project only if its time range is included or overlap the provided range.</p>
<p>If a trace already exists with the same name in the target trace folder, the user can choose to rename the imported trace, overwrite the original trace or skip the trace. When rename is chosen, a number is appended to the trace name, for example smalltrace becomes smalltrace(2).</p>
<p>If one selectsRename All,Overwrite AllorSkip Allthe choice will be applied for all traces with a name conflict.</p>
<p>Upon successful importing, the traces will be stored in the target trace folder. If a trace type was associated to a trace, then the corresponding icon will be displayed. If no trace type is detected the default editor icon associated with this file type will be displayed. Linked traces will have a little arrow as decorator on the right bottom corner.</p>
<p>Depending of the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types can vary.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can open theImport...menu from theFilemain menu, then selectTracing&gt;Trace Importand click onNext &gt;.</p>
<p>At this point, theImport Trace Wizardwill show. To import traces to the tracing project, follow the instructions that were described above.</p>
<h4 id="drag-and-drop-1"><a class="header" href="#drag-and-drop-1">Drag and Drop</a></h4>
<p>Traces can be also be imported to a project by dragging from another tracing project and dropping to the project's target trace folder. The trace will be copied and the trace type will be set.</p>
<p>Any resource can be dragged and dropped from a non-tracing project, and any file or folder can be dragged from an external tool, into a tracing project's trace folder. The resource will be copied or imported as a new trace and it will be attempted to detect the trace types of the imported resource. The automatic detection algorithm validates a trace against all known trace types. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. If no trace type is detected the user needs to set the trace type manually.</p>
<p>To import the trace as a link, use the platform-specific key modifier while dragging the source trace. A link will be created in the target project to the trace's location on the file system.</p>
<p>If a folder containing traces is dropped on a trace folder, the full directory structure will be copied or linked to the target trace folder. The trace type of the contained traces will not be auto-detected.</p>
<p>It is also possible to drop a trace, resource, file or folder into an existing experiment. If the item does not already exist as a trace in the project's trace folder, it will first be copied or imported, then the trace will be added to the experiment.</p>
<h3 id="trace-package-exporting-and-importing-1"><a class="header" href="#trace-package-exporting-and-importing-1">Trace Package Exporting and Importing</a></h3>
<p>A trace package is an archive file that contains the trace itself and can also contain its bookmarks and its supplementary files. Including supplementary files in the package can improve performance of opening an imported trace but at the expense of package size.</p>
<h4 id="exporting-1"><a class="header" href="#exporting-1">Exporting</a></h4>
<p>TheExport Trace Package Wizardallows users to select a trace and export its files and bookmarks to an archive on a media.</p>
<p>TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces available for a tracing project. To export traces contained in theTracesfolder, one can open theExport...menu from theFilemain menu. Then selectTrace Package Export</p>
<p>At this point, theTrace Package Exportis opened. The project containing the traces has to be selected first then the traces to be exported.</p>
<p>One can also open the wizard and skip the first page by expanding the project, selecting traces or trace folders under theTracesfolder, then right-clicking and selecting theExport Trace Package...menu item in the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>Next, the user can choose the content to export and various format options for the resulting file.</p>
<p>TheTraceitem is always selected and represents the files that constitute the trace. TheSupplementary filesitems represent files that are typically generated when a trace is opened by the viewer. Sharing these files can speed up opening a trace dramatically but also increases the size of the exported archive file. TheSizecolumn can help to decide whether or not to include these files. Lastly, by selectingBookmarks, the user can export all the bookmarks so that they can be shared along with the trace.</p>
<p>TheTo archive filefield is used to specify the location where to save the resulting archive.</p>
<p>TheOptionssection allows the user to choose between a tar archive or a zip archive. Compression can also be toggled on or off.</p>
<p>When Finish button is clicked, the package is generated and saved to the media. The folder structure of the selected traces relative to theTracesfolder is preserved in the trace package.</p>
<h4 id="importing-3"><a class="header" href="#importing-3">Importing</a></h4>
<p>TheImport Trace Package Wizardallows users to select a previously exported trace package from their media and import the content of the package in the workspace.</p>
<p>TheTracesfolder holds the set of traces for a tracing project. To import a trace package to theTracesfolder, one can open theImport...menu from theFilemain menu. Then selectTrace Package Import.</p>
<p>One can also open the wizard by expanding the project name, right-clicking on a target folder under theTracesfolder then selectingImport Trace Package...menu item in the context-sensitive menu.</p>

<p>Under the Trace Group element, at least one Trace element must be defined.</p>
<h5 id="trace-1"><a class="header" href="#trace-1">Trace</a></h5>
<p>File pattern: A regular expression pattern to match against the file name of traces found under the root path. If theRecursiveoption is used, the pattern must match against the relative path of the trace, using forward-slash as a path separator. Files that do not match this pattern are ignored. If multiple Trace elements have a matching pattern, the first matching element will be used, and therefore the most specific patterns should be listed first. Following are some pattern examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>.*matches any trace in any folder</li>
<li>[^/]*.logmatches traces with .log extension in the root path folder</li>
<li>.*.logmatches traces with .log extension in any folder</li>

<p>Note that the directory for all supplementary files will be copied, too. (see alsoDeleting Supplementary Files).</p>
<h3 id="deleting-a-trace-or-experiment-1"><a class="header" href="#deleting-a-trace-or-experiment-1">Deleting a Trace or Experiment</a></h3>
<p>To delete a trace or experiment select the relevant trace or experiment in theProject Explorerview and click the right mouse button. Then selectDelete...from the context sensitive menu. The trace or experiment needs to be closed in order to do this operation.</p>
<p>A confirmation dialog box will open. To perform the deletion pressOKotherwise selectCancel.</p>
<p>After successful operation the selected trace or experiment will be removed from the project. In case of a linked trace only the link will be removed. The actual trace resource remain on the disk.</p>
<p>Note that the directory for all supplementary files will be deleted, too. (see alsoDeleting Supplementary Files).</p>
<h3 id="deleting-supplementary-files-1"><a class="header" href="#deleting-supplementary-files-1">Deleting Supplementary Files</a></h3>
<p>Supplementary files are by definition trace specific files that accompany a trace. These file could be temporary files, persistent indexes or any other persistent data files created by the LTTng integration in Eclipse during parsing a trace. For the LTTng 2.0 trace viewer a persistent state history of the Linux Kernel is created and is stored under the namestateHistory.ht. The statistics for all traces are stored understatistics.ht. Other state systems may appear in the same folder as more custom views are added.</p>
<p>All supplementary file are hidden from the user and are handled internally by the TMF. However, there is a possibility to delete the supplementary files so that they are recreated when opening a trace.</p>
<p>To delete all supplementary files from one or many traces and experiments, select the relevant traces and experiments in theProject Explorerview and click the right mouse button. Then select theDelete Supplementary Files...menu item from the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>A new dialog box will open with a list of supplementary files, grouped under the trace or experiment they belong to. Select the file(s) to delete from the list and pressOK. The traces and experiments that need to be closed in order to do this operation will automatically be closed.</p>
<h3 id="displaying-the-traces-time-range-1"><a class="header" href="#displaying-the-traces-time-range-1">Displaying the trace's time range</a></h3>
<p>The trace's time range can be displayed alongside the trace's name. The time is displayed in the Time Format from Tracing preferences.</p>
<p>To enable this feature, head toPreferences &gt; Tracingand check the boxShow trace time range in Project Explorer.</p>
<p>If a trace is empty or its type unknown, nothing will be shown. It the range has not been fully read from the trace or the supplementary files,[...]will be shown. If the trace is being read and only its start timestartis known,[start - ...]will be shown. Finally, when the end timeendis also known,[start - end]will be shown.</p>

This option allowstrimmingthe current trace to a subset of its events, while preserving all the states that may have been computed by various analyses using events present before the exported time range.</p>
<p>TheExporting Time Selection as New Traceoption will create a new trace and import it into the current tracing project. A selection dialog will be presented to the user to define where the new trace should be written. This is where the new trace files will be written, as well as any appropriateinitial statefiles.</p>
<p>The new trace will be initially named the same as the original. The user must then free to rename the new trace. The trace can also be removed from the project and re-imported later with no loss of information.</p>
<p>Note: Since trace writing works differently for every trace type, the trimming feature has to be implemented for the target trace's type. If the option remains grayed out even if a time range is selected, it is because the given trace type does not implement the trim feature.</p>

<h4 id="opening-a-trace-2"><a class="header" href="#opening-a-trace-2">Opening a Trace</a></h4>
<p>To open a trace, right-click on a target trace folder and selectOpen Trace....</p>
<p>A new dialog will show for selecting a trace to open. Select a trace file and then click onOK. Note that for traces that are directories (such as Common Trace Format (CTF) traces) any file in the trace directory can be selected to open the trace. Now, the trace viewer will attempt to detect the trace types of the selected trace. The auto detection algorithm will validate the trace against all known trace types. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. After successful validation the trace will be linked into the selected target trace folder and then opened with the detected trace type.</p>
<p>Depending of the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types can vary.</p>
<h4 id="importing-4"><a class="header" href="#importing-4">Importing</a></h4>
<p>To import a set of traces to a trace folder, right-click on the target folder and selectImport...from the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>At this point, theImport Trace Wizardwill show for selecting traces to import. By default, it shows the correct destination directory where the traces will be imported to. Now, specify the location of the traces in theRoot directory. For that click on the buttonBrowse, browse the media to the location of the traces and click onOK. Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders. If the selected files include archive files (tar, zip), they will be extracted automatically and imported as well.</p>
<p>Traces can also be imported directly from an archive file such as a zip or a tar file by selecting theSelect archive fileoption then by clickingBrowse. Then select the traces to import in the list of files and folders as usual.</p>
<p>Optionally, select theTrace Typefrom the drop-down menu. IfTrace Typeis set to<Automatic Detection>, the wizard will attempt to detect the trace types of the selected files. The automatic detection algorithm validates a trace against all the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. Optionally,Import unrecognized tracescan be selected to import trace files that could not be automatically detected by<Automatic Detection>.</p>
<p>Select or deselect the checkboxes forOverwrite existing trace without warning,Create links in workspaceandPreserve folder structure. When all options are configured, click onFinish.</p>
<p>Note that traces of certain types (e.g. LTTng Kernel) are actually a composite of multiple channel traces grouped under a folder. Either the folder or its files can be selected to import the trace.</p>
<p>The optionPreserve folder structurewill create, if necessary, the structure of folders relative to (and excluding) the selectedRoot directory(orArchive file) into the target trace folder.</p>
<p>The optionCreate Experimentwill create an experiment with all imported traces. By default, the experiment name is theRoot directoryname, when importing from directory, or theArchive filename, when importing from archive. One can change the experiment name by typing a new name in the text box beside the option.</p>
<p>The optionTime Range filteringwill filter your previously selected traces using the given time range. A trace will be imported into the project only if its time range is included or overlap the provided range.</p>
<p>If a trace already exists with the same name in the target trace folder, the user can choose to rename the imported trace, overwrite the original trace or skip the trace. When rename is chosen, a number is appended to the trace name, for example smalltrace becomes smalltrace(2).</p>
<p>If one selectsRename All,Overwrite AllorSkip Allthe choice will be applied for all traces with a name conflict.</p>
<p>Upon successful importing, the traces will be stored in the target trace folder. If a trace type was associated to a trace, then the corresponding icon will be displayed. If no trace type is detected the default editor icon associated with this file type will be displayed. Linked traces will have a little arrow as decorator on the right bottom corner.</p>
<p>Depending of the trace types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types can vary.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can open theImport...menu from theFilemain menu, then selectTracing&gt;Trace Importand click onNext &gt;.</p>
<p>At this point, theImport Trace Wizardwill show. To import traces to the tracing project, follow the instructions that were described above.</p>
<h4 id="drag-and-drop-2"><a class="header" href="#drag-and-drop-2">Drag and Drop</a></h4>
<p>Traces can be also be imported to a project by dragging from another tracing project and dropping to the project's target trace folder. The trace will be copied and the trace type will be set.</p>
<p>Any resource can be dragged and dropped from a non-tracing project, and any file or folder can be dragged from an external tool, into a tracing project's trace folder. The resource will be copied or imported as a new trace and it will be attempted to detect the trace types of the imported resource. The automatic detection algorithm validates a trace against all known trace types. If multiple trace types are valid, a trace type is chosen based on a confidence criteria. The validation process and the computation of the confidence level are trace type specific. If no trace type is detected the user needs to set the trace type manually.</p>
<p>To import the trace as a link, use the platform-specific key modifier while dragging the source trace. A link will be created in the target project to the trace's location on the file system.</p>
<p>If a folder containing traces is dropped on a trace folder, the full directory structure will be copied or linked to the target trace folder. The trace type of the contained traces will not be auto-detected.</p>
<p>It is also possible to drop a trace, resource, file or folder into an existing experiment. If the item does not already exist as a trace in the project's trace folder, it will first be copied or imported, then the trace will be added to the experiment.</p>

<li>Event Type: the event type</li>
<li>Contents: the fields (or payload) of this event</li>

<p>The first row of the table is the header row a.k.a. the Search and Filter row.</p>
<p>The highlighted event is thecurrent eventand is synchronized with the other views. If you select another event, the other views will be updated accordingly. The properties view will display a more detailed view of the selected event.</p>
<p>An event range can be selected by holding theShiftkey while clicking another event or using any of the cursor keys (Up',Down,PageUp,PageDown,Home,End). The first and last events in the selection will be used to determine the current selected time range for synchronization with the other views.</p>
<p>The Events editor can be closed, disposing a trace. When this is done, all the views displaying the information will be updated with the trace data of the next event editor tab. If all the editor tabs are closed, then the views will display their empty states.</p>

<p>A status row will be displayed before and after the matching events, dynamically showing how many matching events were found and how many events were processed so far. Once the filtering is completed, the status row icon in the left margin will change from a 'stop' to a 'filter' icon.</p>
<p>PressEscto stop an ongoing filtering. In this case the status row icon will remain as a 'stop' icon to indicate that not all events were processed.</p>
<p>The header bar will be displayed above the table and will show a label for each applied filter. Clicking on a label will highlight the matching strings in the events that correspond to this filter condition. Pressing theDeletekey will clear this highlighting.</p>
<p>To remove a specific filter, click on theicon on its label in the header bar. The table will be updated with the events matching the remaining filters.</p>

<p>The large (full) histogram, at the bottom, shows the event distribution over the whole trace or set of traces. It also has a smaller semi-transparent orange window, with a cross-hair, that shows the current zoom window.</p>
<p>The smaller (zoom) histogram, on top right, corresponds to the current zoom window, a sub-range of the event set. The window size can be adjusted by dragging the sash left beside the zoom window.</p>
<p>The x-axis of each histogram corresponds to the event timestamps. The axis is now the same as the other views for a better visualization of the range. The y-axis shows the maximum number of events in the corresponding histogram bars.</p>
<p>The vertical blue line(s) show the current selection time (or range). If applicable, the region in the selection range will be shaded. In addition, when a selection is performed the status line (line placed at the very left bottom corner of Trace Compass) is now updated with the cursor position, the selection time or range and the delta for a range.</p>

<p>The Statistics View displays the various event counters that are collected when analyzing a trace. After opening a trace, the elementStatisticsis added under theTmf Statistics Analysistree element in the Project Explorer. To open the view, double-click theStatisticstree element. Alternatively, selectStatisticsunderTracingwithin theShow Viewwindow (Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...). The statistics is collected for the whole trace. This view is part of theTracing and Monitoring Framework (TMF)and is generic. It will work for any trace type extensions.</p>
<p>The view is separated in two sides. The left side of the view presents the Statistics in a table. The table shows 3 columns:LevelEvents totalandEvents in selected time range. The data is organized per trace. After parsing a trace the view will display the number of events per event type in the second column and in the third, the currently selected time range's event type distribution is shown. The cells where the number of events are printed also contain a colored bar with a number that indicates the percentage of the event count in relation to the total number of events.</p>
<p>The right side illustrates the proportion of types of events into two pie charts. The legend of each pie chart gives the representation of each color in the chart.</p>
<ul>
<li>TheGlobalpie chart displays the general proportion of the events in the trace.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="colors-view-1"><a class="header" href="#colors-view-1">Colors View</a></h2>
<p>The Colors view allows the user to define a prioritized list of color settings.</p>
<p>A color setting associates a foreground and background color (used in any events table), and a tick color (used in the Time Chart view), with an event filter.</p>
<p>In an events table, any event row that matches the event filter of a color setting will be displayed with the specified foreground and background colors. If the event matches multiple filters, the color setting with the highest priority will be used.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the event tick colors in the Time Chart view. If a tick represents many events, the tick color of the highest priority matching event will be used.</p>
<p>Color settings can be inserted, deleted, reordered, imported and exported using the buttons in the Colors view toolbar. Changes to the color settings are applied immediately, and are persisted to disk.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="filters-view-1"><a class="header" href="#filters-view-1">Filters View</a></h2>
<p>The Filters view allows the user to define preset filters that can be applied to any events table.</p>
<p>The filters can be more complex than what can be achieved with the filter header row in the events table. The filter is defined in a tree node structure, where the node types can be any ofTRACETYPE,AND,OR,CONTAINS,EQUALS,MATCHESorCOMPARE. Some nodes types have restrictions on their possible children in the tree.</p>
<p>TheTRACETYPEnode filters against the trace type of the trace as defined in a plug-in extension or in a custom parser. When used, any child node will have itstypecombo box fixed and itsaspectcombo box restricted to the possible aspects of that trace type. Depending of the Trace Types enabled in theTrace Types preference page, the list of available trace types for the filtering can vary.</p>
<p>TheANDnode applies the logicalandcondition on all of its children. All children conditions must be true for the filter to match. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition.</p>
<p>TheORnode applies the logicalorcondition on all of its children. At least one children condition must be true for the filter to match. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition.</p>
<p>TheCONTAINSnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue contains the specifiedvaluestring. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. The condition can be case sensitive or insensitive. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheEQUALSnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue equals exactly the specifiedvaluestring. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. The condition can be case sensitive or insensitive. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheMATCHESnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue matches against the specifiedregular expression. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>TheCOMPAREnode matches when the specified eventaspectvalue compared with the specifiedvaluegives the specifiedresult. The result can be set tosmaller than,equalorgreater than. The type of comparison can be numerical, alphanumerical or based on time stamp. Anotoperator can be applied to invert the condition. Thetypecombo box restricts the possible aspects to those of the specified trace type.</p>
<p>For numerical comparisons, strings prefixed by "0x", "0X" or "#" are treated as hexadecimal numbers and strings prefixed by "0" are treated as octal numbers.</p>
<p>For time stamp comparisons, strings are treated as seconds with or without fraction of seconds. This corresponds to theTTTformat in theTime Formatpreferences. The value for a selected event can be found in thePropertiesview under theTimestampproperty. The common 'Timestamp' aspect can always be used for time stamp comparisons regardless of its time format.</p>
<p>Filters can be added, deleted, imported and exported using the buttons in the Filters view toolbar. The nodes in the view can be Cut (Ctrl-X), Copied (Ctrl-C) and Pasted (Ctrl-V) by using the buttons in the toolbar or by using the key bindings. This makes it easier to quickly build new filters from existing ones. Changes to the preset filters are only applied and persisted to disk when theSave filtersbutton is pressed.</p>
<p>To apply a saved preset filter in an events table, right-click on the table and selectApply preset filter...&gt;filter name.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="time-chart-view-1"><a class="header" href="#time-chart-view-1">Time Chart View</a></h2>
<p>The Time Chart view allows the user to visualize every open trace in a common time chart. Each trace is display in its own row and ticks are display for every punctual event. As the user zooms using the mouse wheel or by right-clicking and dragging in the time scale, more detailed event data is computed from the traces. The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>Time synchronization is enabled between the time chart view and other trace viewers such as the events table.</p>
<p>Color settings defined in the Colors view can be used to change the tick color of events displayed in the Time Chart view.</p>
<p>When a search is applied in the events table, the ticks corresponding to matching events in the Time Chart view are decorated with a marker below the tick.</p>
<p>When a bookmark is applied in the events table, the ticks corresponding to the bookmarked event in the Time Chart view is decorated with a bookmark above the tick.</p>
<p>When a filter is applied in the events table, the non-matching ticks are removed from the Time Chart view.</p>
<p>The Time Chart only supports traces that are opened in an editor. The use of an editor is specified in the plug-in extension for that trace type, or is enabled by default for custom traces.</p>
<p>TheAlign Viewstoggle buttonin the view menu allows to disable and enable the automatic time axis alignment of time-based views. Disabling the alignment in the this view will disable this feature across all the views because it's a workspace preference.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="state-system-explorer-view-1"><a class="header" href="#state-system-explorer-view-1">State System Explorer View</a></h2>
<p>The State System Explorer view allows the user to inspect the state interval values of every attribute of a state system at a particular time.</p>
<p>The view shows a tree of currently selected traces and their registered state system IDs. For each state system the tree structure of attributes is displayed. The attribute name, quark, value, start and end time, and full attribute path are shown for each attribute.</p>
<p>To modify the time of attributes shown in the view, select a different current time in other views that support time synchronization (e.g. event table, histogram view). When a time range is selected, this view uses the begin time.</p>

<p>Trace Compass supports the execution ofexternal analysesconforming to theLAMI 1.0.x specification. This includes recent versions of theLTTng-Analyses project.</p>
<p>An external analysis is aprogram executed by Trace Compass. When the program is done analyzing, Trace Compass generates areportcontaining its results. A report contains one or more tables which can also be viewed as bar and scattercharts.</p>
<p>Note: The program to execute is found by searching the directories listed in the standard$PATHenvironment variable when no path separator (/on Unix and OS X,\on Windows) is found in its command.</p>
<p>Trace Compass ships with a default list ofdescriptorsof external analyses (not the analyses themselves), including the descriptors of theLTTng analyses. If the LTTng analyses project is installed, its analyses are available when opening or importing an LTTng kernel trace.</p>

</ul>
<p>Important note:The custom parsers identify a log entry when the first line's regular expression matches (Root Line n). Each subsequent text line in the log is attempted to be matched against the regular expression of the parser's input lines in the order that they are defined (Line n.*). Only the first matching input line will be used to process the captured data to be stored in the log entry. When a text line matches a Root Line's regular expression, a new log entry is started.</p>

<li>Event type: Optionally enable this text field to enter an event type name that will override the default (trace type) when this line matches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note:The custom parsers identify a log entry when the first line's regular expression matches (Root Line n). Each subsequent text line in the log is attempted to be matched against the regular expression of the parser's input lines in the order that they are defined (Line n.*). Only the first matching input line will be used to process the captured data to be stored in the log entry. When a text line matches a Root Line's regular expression, a new log entry is started.</p>

<p>Some views, such as time graph and XY chart views, can be opened multiple times in order to show content from different traces and/or window ranges simultaneously. This can be done by using theNew <view name> viewsub-menu in the view'sView Menuat the far right of the tool bar.</p>
<p>By default, a view shows content from the active trace, which is the last trace whose events editor tab has been selected.</p>
<p>When a view is pinned, it no longer follows the active trace and is locked to the trace to which it is pinned. The view's tab will show the pinned trace's name within brackets, e.g. View Name <trace name>.</p>
<p>A view can be pinned to the current active trace by clicking thePin Viewbuttonon the tool bar, or pinned to any specific opened trace by using thePin Viewbutton's drop-down menu. This drop-down menu can also be used to switch the pinned trace of a pinned view. Once a view is pinned, it can be unpinned by clicking theUnpin Viewbuttonon the tool bar.</p>

<p>All time-based views that show the same trace are synchronized in time to show the same window range and time selection. This also applies to the selected event(s) in theEvents Editor.</p>
<p>By default, changing the window range or time selection for one trace does not affect the window range or time selection of other opened traces.</p>
<p>To allow a specific trace to be synchronized with (and react to) the window range or time selection from other traces, check theFollow time updates from other tracestoggle option in that trace'sEvent Editorcontext menu. This does not affect whether this trace's time updates will be propagated to other traces.</p>
<p>Time synchronization will only occur if the updated window range or time selection from the other trace overlaps with the full time range of the following trace. It will occur even if the following trace is not the active trace.</p>
<p>Note that two opened instances of the same trace are never time synchronized with each other, regardless of the toggle option.</p>

Also if needed, change the tracing project from theAvailable Projectscombo box. The optionCreate Experimentwill create an experiment with all imported traces. By default, the experiment name is the session name. One can change the experiment name by typing a new name in the text box beside the option.</p>
<p>Then press buttonFinish. Upon successful import operation the selected traces will be stored in theTracesdirectory of the specified tracing project. A directory with the connection name will be created under theTracesdirectory. Underneath that, the session directory structure as well as the trace names will be preserved in the destination tracing project. ForKerneltraces the trace typeLinux Kernel Traceand forUSTtraces the trace typeLTTng UST Tracewill be set. From theProject Explorerview, the trace can be analyzed further.</p>
<p>Note: If a trace already exists with the same name in the destination directory, the user can choose to rename the imported trace, overwrite the original trace or skip the trace. When rename is chosen, a number is appended to the trace name, for example kernel becomes kernel(2).</p>
<p>If one selectsRename All,Overwrite AllorSkip Allthe choice will be applied for all traces with a name conflict.</p>

<h3 id="saving-tracing-sessions"><a class="header" href="#saving-tracing-sessions">Saving Tracing Sessions</a></h3>
<p>Since LTTng Tools v2.5.0 it is possible to save tracing sessions. The LTTng Tools command-line tool will save the sessions to XML files located by default in a subdirectory of the user's home directory. The Trace CompassControlview integration for this feature will also store this session profile file into the user's Trace Compass workspace. This will allow user's to re-use session profiles across remote nodes. To save one or more sessions, select the tree nodes of the relevant sessions and press the right mouse button. Then select theSave...entry of the context-sensitive menu.</p>
<p>A new display will open for saving the sessions.</p>
<p>By default theforcebutton is selected that will overwrite any conflicting session profile files on the remote node. Click onOkto save the session(s) otherwise click onCancel. Upon successful operation, the session profile files will be saved on the remote node and then will be downloaded to the user's Trace Compass workspace.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lttng-kernel-analysis"><a class="header" href="#lttng-kernel-analysis">LTTng Kernel Analysis</a></h1>
<p>Historically, LTTng was developed to trace the Linux kernel and, over time, a number of kernel-oriented analysis views were developed and organized in a perspective.</p>
<p>This section presents a description of theOS Tracing Overviewperspective and theLTTng Kernelperspective.</p>
<h2 id="os-tracing-overview-perspective"><a class="header" href="#os-tracing-overview-perspective">OS Tracing Overview Perspective</a></h2>
<p>TheOS Tracing Overviewperspective groups the following views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Explorer View</li>
<li>Events Editor</li>
<li>Histogram View</li>
<li>CPU Usage View</li>
<li>Disk I/O Activity View</li>
<li>Kernel Memory Usage View</li>
<li>Project Explorer View</li>
<li>Events Editor</li>
<li>Histogram View</li>
<li>CPU Usage View</li>
<li>Disk I/O Activity View</li>
<li>Kernel Memory Usage View</li>
</ul>
<p>The perspective can be opened from the Eclipse Open Perspective dialog (Window &gt; Open Perspective... &gt; Other).</p>
<p>This perspective is intended to be used to locate performance issues by observing resource usage.</p>
<p>The perspective can show times resource usage is anomalous. This can help locating the causes of system slowdowns in throughput or response time.</p>
<p>An example can be program that is doing a lot of processing then slows down due to a database access. The user will see a dip in CPU usage and maybe a slight rise in I/O access. The user should consider both spike and slums to be an indication of an area worth investigating.</p>
<p>Once a performance issue has been localized, it can be further investigated with the #LTTng kernel Perspective.</p>
<h2 id="lttng-kernel-perspective"><a class="header" href="#lttng-kernel-perspective">LTTng Kernel Perspective</a></h2>
<p>TheLTTng Kernelperspective is built upon theTracing Perspective, re-organizes them slightly and adds the following views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control Flow View- to visualize processes state transitions</li>
<li>Resources View- to visualize system resources state transitions</li>
<li>LTTng Tracer Control- to configure LTTng tracing sessions remotely</li>
<li>Control Flow View- to visualize processes state transitions</li>
<li>Resources View- to visualize system resources state transitions</li>
<li>LTTng Tracer Control- to configure LTTng tracing sessions remotely</li>
</ul>
<p>The perspective can be opened from the Eclipse Open Perspective dialog (Window &gt; Open Perspective... &gt; Other).</p>
<h2 id="control-flow-view"><a class="header" href="#control-flow-view">Control Flow View</a></h2>
<p>TheControl Flowview is a LTTng-specific view that shows per-process events graphically. The Linux Kernel Analysis is executed the first time a LTTng Kernel is opened. After opening the trace, the elementControl Flowis added under theLinux Kernel Analysistree element in the Project Explorer. To open the view,  double-click theControl Flowtree element.</p>
<p>Alternatively, selectControl FlowunderLTTngwithin theShow Viewwindow (Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...):</p>
<p>You should get something like this:</p>
<p>The view is divided into the following important sections:process tree and information,control flowand thetoolbar. The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>The following sections provide detailed information for each part of the Control Flow View.</p>
<h3 id="process-tree-and-information"><a class="header" href="#process-tree-and-information">Process tree and information</a></h3>
<p>Processes are organized as a tree within this view. This way, child and parent processes are easy to identify.</p>
<p>The layout is based on the states computed from the trace events.</p>
<p>A given process may be shown at different places within the tree since the nodes areunique (TID, birth time) couples. This means that if process B of parent A dies, you'll still see it in the tree. If process A forks process B again, it will be shown as a different node since it won't have the same birth time (and probably not the same TID). This has the advantage that the tree, once loaded, never changes: horizontal scrolling within thecontrol flowremains possible.</p>
<p>The TID column shows the process node'sthread IDand the PTID column shows itsparent thread ID(nothing is shown if the process has no parent).</p>
<p>It is possible to sort the columns of the tree by clicking on the column header. Subsequent clicking will change the sort order. The hierarchy, i.e. the parent-child relationship is kept. When opening a trace for the first time, the processes are sorted bybirth time. The sort order and column will be preserved when switching between open traces. Note that when opening an experiment the processes will be sorted within each trace.</p>
<h3 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control flow</a></h3>
<p>This part of the Control Flow View is probably the most interesting one. Using the mouse, you can navigate through the trace (go left, right) and zoom on a specific region to inspect its details.</p>
<p>The colored bars you see representstatesfor the associated process node. When a process state changes in time, so does the color. For stateSYSCALLthe name of the system call is displayed in the state bar. States colors legend is available through atoolbar button:</p>
<p>The style can be updated in the legend.</p>
<p>This dark yellow is what you'll see most of the time since scheduling puts processes on hold while others run.</p>
<p>The vertical blue line with T1 above it is thecurrent selection indicator. When a time range is selected, the region between the begin and end time of the selection will be shaded and two lines with T1 and T2 above will be displayed. The time stamps corresponding to T1, T2 and their delta are shown in the status line when the mouse is hovering over the control flow.</p>
<p>Arrows can be displayed that follow the execution of each CPU across processes. The arrows indicate when the scheduler switches from one process to another for a given CPU. The CPU being followed is indicated on the state tooltip. When the scheduler switches to and from the idle process, the arrow skips to the next process which executes on the CPU after the idle process. Note that an appropriate zoom level is required for all arrows to be displayed.</p>
<p>The display of arrows is optional and can be toggled using theHide Arrowstoolbar button. It is also possible to follow a CPU's execution across state changes and the scheduler's process switching using theFollow CPU Forward/Backwardtoolbar buttons.</p>
<h4 id="using-the-mouse"><a class="header" href="#using-the-mouse">Using the mouse</a></h4>
<p>The following mouse actions are available:</p>

<li>drag the time ruler horizontally: zoom in or out with fixed start time</li>
<li>double-click the time ruler: reset zoom to full range</li>
</ul>
<p>When the current time indicator is changed (when clicking in the states flow), all the other views aresynchronized. For example, theEvents Editorwill show the event matching the current time indicator. The reverse behaviour is also implemented: selecting an event within the Events View will update the Control Flow View current time indicator.</p>

<p>The Show Active Threads Only filter allow a user to increase the signal to noise ratio by filtering out allinactivethreads.</p>
<p>A thread is considered inactive when it is in the following state:</p>
<ul>
<li>non-existing</li>
<li>unknown</li>
<li>wait and blocked</li>
<li>wait and unknown</li>
<li>non-existing</li>
<li>unknown</li>
<li>wait and blocked</li>
<li>wait and unknown</li>
</ul>
<p>A user can fine tune this filter by providing ranges of CPUs allowing the filter to only show active thread running on the specified CPUs.</p>

<p>The marker axis is visible only when at least one marker category with markers for the current trace is shown.</p>
<p>The marker axis displays one row per marker category. Each marker's time range and/or label (if applicable) are drawn on the marker axis.</p>
<p>Clicking on any marker's time range or label will set the current time selection to the marker's time or time range. Shift-clicking will extend the current time selection to include the marker's time or time range.</p>
<p>Clicking on the "X" icon to the left of the marker category name will hide this marker category from the time graph. It can be shown again using the correspondingShow Markersmenu item in the view menu.</p>
<p>The marker axis can be collapsed and expanded by clicking on the icon at the top left of the marker axis. The marker axis can be completely removed by hiding all available marker categories.</p>
<h2 id="resources-view"><a class="header" href="#resources-view">Resources View</a></h2>
<p>This view is specific to LTTng kernel traces.  The Linux Kernel Analysis is executed the first time a LTTng Kernel is opened. After opening the trace, the elementResourcesis added under theLinux Kernel Analysistree element of the Project Explorer. To open the view, double-click theResourcestree element.</p>
<p>Alternatively, go inWindow-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...and selectLTTng/Resourcesin the list.</p>
<p>This view shows the state of system resources i.e. if changes occurred during the trace either onCPUs,IRQsorsoft IRQs, it will appear in this view. The left side of the view present a list of resources that are affected by at least one event of the trace. The right side illustrate the state in which each resource is at some point in time. For stateUSERMODEit also prints the process name in the state bar. For stateSYSCALLthe name of the system call is
displayed in the state region.</p>
<p>When anIRQis handled by aCPU, its states are shown under the correspondingCPUentry. Similarly, theCPUthat was handling anIRQis shown under the handledIRQ. Therefore, the trace can be visualized from aCPUpoint of view or from anIRQpoint of view.</p>
<p>Just like other views, according to which trace points and system calls are activated, the content of this view may change from one trace to another.</p>
<p>The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>Each state are represented by one color so it is faster to say what is happening.</p>
<p>The style can be updated in the legend.</p>
<p>To go through the state of a resource, you first have to select the resource and the timestamp that interest you. For the latter, you can pick some time before the interesting part of the trace.</p>
<p>Then, by selectingNext Event, it will show the next state transition and the event that occurred at this time.</p>

<h2 id="process-wait-analysis"><a class="header" href="#process-wait-analysis">Process Wait Analysis</a></h2>
<p>TraceCompass can recover wait causes of local and distributed processes using operating system events. The analysis highlights the tasks and devices causing wait. Wait cause recovery is recursive, comprise all tasks running on the system and works across computers using packet trace synchronization.</p>
<p>The analysis details are available in the paperWait analysis of distributed systems using kernel tracing.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h3>
<p>The analysis requires a Linux kernel trace. Additional instrumentation may be required for specific kernel version and for distributed tracing. This instrumentation is available inLTTng modules addonson GitHub.</p>
<p>The required events are:</p>
<ul>
<li>sched_switch, sched_wakeup: Scheduling events indicate when a process is blocked and the wake-up event indicates the task or resource that unblocked the task. For kernel versions comprised between 3.8 and 4.1, the eventsched_ttwu(which stands for Try To Wake-Up) is provided for backward compatibility in LTTng modules addons.</li>
<li>IRQ, SoftIRQ and IPI: Interrupt events are required to distinguish the context of the wake-up. When a wake-up occurs inside an interrupt handler, it must be associated with the device causing the interrupt and not the interrupted task. For that reason, interrupt entry and exit events are required.</li>
<li>inet_sock_local_in, inet_sock_local_out: The network events record a subset of TCP/IP packet header using a netfilter hook in the kernel. The send and receive events are matched to show the communication between distributed processes. Network events are mandatory for analyzing wait in TCP/IP programs, whether they are executing locally or on different computers. They also used to synchronize traces recorded on multiple computers. For further details, refer to theTrace synchronizationsection.</li>

<p>To analyze a distributed program, all computers involved in the processing must be traced simultaneously. The LTTng Tracer Control of TraceCompass can trace a remote computer, but controlling simultaneous tracing is not supported at the moment, meaning that all sessions must be started separately and interactively. TraceCompass will support this feature in the future. For now, it is suggested to uselttng-clustercommand line tool to control simultaneous tracing sessions on multiple computers. This tool is based onFabricand uses SSH to start the tracing sessions, execute a workload, stop the sessions and gather traces on the local computer. For more information, refer to the lttng-cluster documentation.</p>
<p>We use theDjango traceas an example to demonstrate the wait analysis.Djangois a popular Web framework. The application is theDjango Poll app tutorial. The traces were recorded on three computers, namely the client (implemented with Python Mechanize), the Web server (Apache with WSGI) and the database server (PostgreSQL). The client simulates a vote in the poll.</p>
<h3 id="running-the-analysis"><a class="header" href="#running-the-analysis">Running the analysis</a></h3>
<p>To open all three traces simultaneously, we first create an experiment containing these traces and then synchronize the traces, such that they have a common time base. Then, the analysis is done by selecting a task in theControl Flow View. The result is displayed in theCritical Flow View, which works like theControl Flow View. The steps to load the Django example follows.</p>

<p>An example can be program that is doing a lot of processing then slows down due to a database access. The user will see a dip in CPU usage and maybe a slight rise in I/O access. The user should consider both spike and slums to be an indication of an area worth investigating.</p>
<p>Once a performance issue has been localized, it can be further investigated with the #LTTng kernel Perspective.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="lttng-kernel-perspective-1"><a class="header" href="#lttng-kernel-perspective-1">LTTng Kernel Perspective</a></h2>
<p>TheLTTng Kernelperspective is built upon theTracing Perspective, re-organizes them slightly and adds the following views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control Flow View- to visualize processes state transitions</li>
<li>Resources View- to visualize system resources state transitions</li>
<li>LTTng Tracer Control- to configure LTTng tracing sessions remotely</li>
<li>Control Flow View- to visualize processes state transitions</li>
<li>Resources View- to visualize system resources state transitions</li>
<li>LTTng Tracer Control- to configure LTTng tracing sessions remotely</li>
</ul>
<p>The perspective can be opened from the Eclipse Open Perspective dialog (Window &gt; Open Perspective... &gt; Other).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="control-flow-view-1"><a class="header" href="#control-flow-view-1">Control Flow View</a></h2>
<p>TheControl Flowview is a LTTng-specific view that shows per-process events graphically. The Linux Kernel Analysis is executed the first time a LTTng Kernel is opened. After opening the trace, the elementControl Flowis added under theLinux Kernel Analysistree element in the Project Explorer. To open the view,  double-click theControl Flowtree element.</p>
<p>Alternatively, selectControl FlowunderLTTngwithin theShow Viewwindow (Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...):</p>
<p>You should get something like this:</p>
<p>The view is divided into the following important sections:process tree and information,control flowand thetoolbar. The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>The following sections provide detailed information for each part of the Control Flow View.</p>
<h3 id="process-tree-and-information-1"><a class="header" href="#process-tree-and-information-1">Process tree and information</a></h3>
<p>Processes are organized as a tree within this view. This way, child and parent processes are easy to identify.</p>
<p>The layout is based on the states computed from the trace events.</p>
<p>A given process may be shown at different places within the tree since the nodes areunique (TID, birth time) couples. This means that if process B of parent A dies, you'll still see it in the tree. If process A forks process B again, it will be shown as a different node since it won't have the same birth time (and probably not the same TID). This has the advantage that the tree, once loaded, never changes: horizontal scrolling within thecontrol flowremains possible.</p>
<p>The TID column shows the process node'sthread IDand the PTID column shows itsparent thread ID(nothing is shown if the process has no parent).</p>
<p>It is possible to sort the columns of the tree by clicking on the column header. Subsequent clicking will change the sort order. The hierarchy, i.e. the parent-child relationship is kept. When opening a trace for the first time, the processes are sorted bybirth time. The sort order and column will be preserved when switching between open traces. Note that when opening an experiment the processes will be sorted within each trace.</p>
<h3 id="control-flow-1"><a class="header" href="#control-flow-1">Control flow</a></h3>
<p>This part of the Control Flow View is probably the most interesting one. Using the mouse, you can navigate through the trace (go left, right) and zoom on a specific region to inspect its details.</p>
<p>The colored bars you see representstatesfor the associated process node. When a process state changes in time, so does the color. For stateSYSCALLthe name of the system call is displayed in the state bar. States colors legend is available through atoolbar button:</p>
<p>The style can be updated in the legend.</p>
<p>This dark yellow is what you'll see most of the time since scheduling puts processes on hold while others run.</p>
<p>The vertical blue line with T1 above it is thecurrent selection indicator. When a time range is selected, the region between the begin and end time of the selection will be shaded and two lines with T1 and T2 above will be displayed. The time stamps corresponding to T1, T2 and their delta are shown in the status line when the mouse is hovering over the control flow.</p>
<p>Arrows can be displayed that follow the execution of each CPU across processes. The arrows indicate when the scheduler switches from one process to another for a given CPU. The CPU being followed is indicated on the state tooltip. When the scheduler switches to and from the idle process, the arrow skips to the next process which executes on the CPU after the idle process. Note that an appropriate zoom level is required for all arrows to be displayed.</p>
<p>The display of arrows is optional and can be toggled using theHide Arrowstoolbar button. It is also possible to follow a CPU's execution across state changes and the scheduler's process switching using theFollow CPU Forward/Backwardtoolbar buttons.</p>
<h4 id="using-the-mouse-2"><a class="header" href="#using-the-mouse-2">Using the mouse</a></h4>

</ul>
<p>When the current time indicator is changed (when clicking in the states flow), all the other views aresynchronized. For example, theEvents Editorwill show the event matching the current time indicator. The reverse behaviour is also implemented: selecting an event within the Events View will update the Control Flow View current time indicator.</p>

<p>The dynamics filters  can be fine tuned in the configuration dialog.</p>
<p>Note: Dynamic filters can induce performance degradation.</p>
<h5 id="show-active-threads-only-1"><a class="header" href="#show-active-threads-only-1">Show Active Threads Only</a></h5>
<p>The Show Active Threads Only filter allow a user to increase the signal to noise ratio by filtering out allinactivethreads.</p>
<p>A thread is considered inactive when it is in the following state:</p>
<ul>
<li>non-existing</li>
<li>unknown</li>
<li>wait and blocked</li>
<li>wait and unknown</li>
<li>non-existing</li>

<h3 id="marker-axis-2"><a class="header" href="#marker-axis-2">Marker Axis</a></h3>
<p>The marker axis is visible only when at least one marker category with markers for the current trace is shown.</p>
<p>The marker axis displays one row per marker category. Each marker's time range and/or label (if applicable) are drawn on the marker axis.</p>
<p>Clicking on any marker's time range or label will set the current time selection to the marker's time or time range. Shift-clicking will extend the current time selection to include the marker's time or time range.</p>
<p>Clicking on the "X" icon to the left of the marker category name will hide this marker category from the time graph. It can be shown again using the correspondingShow Markersmenu item in the view menu.</p>

<p>This view is specific to LTTng kernel traces.  The Linux Kernel Analysis is executed the first time a LTTng Kernel is opened. After opening the trace, the elementResourcesis added under theLinux Kernel Analysistree element of the Project Explorer. To open the view, double-click theResourcestree element.</p>
<p>Alternatively, go inWindow-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...and selectLTTng/Resourcesin the list.</p>
<p>This view shows the state of system resources i.e. if changes occurred during the trace either onCPUs,IRQsorsoft IRQs, it will appear in this view. The left side of the view present a list of resources that are affected by at least one event of the trace. The right side illustrate the state in which each resource is at some point in time. For stateUSERMODEit also prints the process name in the state bar. For stateSYSCALLthe name of the system call is
displayed in the state region.</p>
<p>When anIRQis handled by aCPU, its states are shown under the correspondingCPUentry. Similarly, theCPUthat was handling anIRQis shown under the handledIRQ. Therefore, the trace can be visualized from aCPUpoint of view or from anIRQpoint of view.</p>
<p>Just like other views, according to which trace points and system calls are activated, the content of this view may change from one trace to another.</p>
<p>The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>Each state are represented by one color so it is faster to say what is happening.</p>
<p>The style can be updated in the legend.</p>
<p>To go through the state of a resource, you first have to select the resource and the timestamp that interest you. For the latter, you can pick some time before the interesting part of the trace.</p>
<p>Then, by selectingNext Event, it will show the next state transition and the event that occurred at this time.</p>

<p>TraceCompass can recover wait causes of local and distributed processes using operating system events. The analysis highlights the tasks and devices causing wait. Wait cause recovery is recursive, comprise all tasks running on the system and works across computers using packet trace synchronization.</p>
<p>The analysis details are available in the paperWait analysis of distributed systems using kernel tracing.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites-1"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</a></h3>
<p>The analysis requires a Linux kernel trace. Additional instrumentation may be required for specific kernel version and for distributed tracing. This instrumentation is available inLTTng modules addonson GitHub.</p>
<p>The required events are:</p>
<ul>
<li>sched_switch, sched_wakeup: Scheduling events indicate when a process is blocked and the wake-up event indicates the task or resource that unblocked the task. For kernel versions comprised between 3.8 and 4.1, the eventsched_ttwu(which stands for Try To Wake-Up) is provided for backward compatibility in LTTng modules addons.</li>
<li>IRQ, SoftIRQ and IPI: Interrupt events are required to distinguish the context of the wake-up. When a wake-up occurs inside an interrupt handler, it must be associated with the device causing the interrupt and not the interrupted task. For that reason, interrupt entry and exit events are required.</li>
<li>inet_sock_local_in, inet_sock_local_out: The network events record a subset of TCP/IP packet header using a netfilter hook in the kernel. The send and receive events are matched to show the communication between distributed processes. Network events are mandatory for analyzing wait in TCP/IP programs, whether they are executing locally or on different computers. They also used to synchronize traces recorded on multiple computers. For further details, refer to theTrace synchronizationsection.</li>

<p>To analyze a distributed program, all computers involved in the processing must be traced simultaneously. The LTTng Tracer Control of TraceCompass can trace a remote computer, but controlling simultaneous tracing is not supported at the moment, meaning that all sessions must be started separately and interactively. TraceCompass will support this feature in the future. For now, it is suggested to uselttng-clustercommand line tool to control simultaneous tracing sessions on multiple computers. This tool is based onFabricand uses SSH to start the tracing sessions, execute a workload, stop the sessions and gather traces on the local computer. For more information, refer to the lttng-cluster documentation.</p>
<p>We use theDjango traceas an example to demonstrate the wait analysis.Djangois a popular Web framework. The application is theDjango Poll app tutorial. The traces were recorded on three computers, namely the client (implemented with Python Mechanize), the Web server (Apache with WSGI) and the database server (PostgreSQL). The client simulates a vote in the poll.</p>

<h2 id="flame-chart-view"><a class="header" href="#flame-chart-view">Flame Chart View</a></h2>
<p>The Flame Chart view allows the user to visualize the call stack per thread over time, if the application and trace provide this information.</p>
<p>To open this view go inWindow-&gt;Show View, if in the eclipse plug-in then clickOther...and selectTracing/Flame Chartin the list. The view shows the call stack information for the currently selected trace. Conversely, you can select a trace and expand it in theProject Explorerthen expandLTTng-UST CallStack Analysis(the trace must be loaded) and openFlame Chart.</p>
<p>The table on the left-hand side of the view shows the threads and call stack. The function name, depth, entry and exit time and duration are shown for the call stack at the selected time.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a function entry in the table will zoom the time graph to the selected function's range of execution.</p>
<p>The time graph on the right-hand side of the view shows the call stack state graphically over time. The function name is visible on each call stack event if size permits. The color of each call stack event is randomly assigned based on the function name, allowing for easy identification of repeated calls to the same function.</p>
<p>Clicking on the time graph will set the current time and consequently update the table with the current call stack information.</p>
<p>Shift-clicking on the time graph will select a time range. When the selection is a time range, the begin time is used to update the stack information.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a call stack event will zoom the time graph to the selected function's range of execution.</p>
<p>Clicking theSelect Next State ChangeorSelect Previous State Changeor using the left and right arrows will navigate to the next or previous call stack event, and select the function currently at the top of the call stack. Note that pressing theShiftkey at the same time will update the selection end time of the current selection.</p>
<p>Clicking theConfigure how addresses are mapped to function names() icon will open the symbol providers dialog. Depending on the available symbol providers for the given trace, you can specify: 1) a text or binary file containing mappings from function addresses to function names or 2) the root location of the binaries of the trace target. If the call stack provider for the current trace type only provides function addresses, a mapping file will be required to get the function names in the view. See the following sections for an example with LTTng-UST traces.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-flame-chart-view-with-lttng-ust-traces"><a class="header" href="#using-the-flame-chart-view-with-lttng-ust-traces">Using the Flame Chart View with LTTng-UST traces</a></h3>
<p>There is support in the LTTng-UST integration plugin to display the callstack
of applications traced with theliblttng-ust-cyg-profile.solibrary (see
theliblttng-ust-cyg-profileman page for additional information). To do
so, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recompile your application with "-g -finstrument-functions".</li>
<li>Set up a tracing session with the thevpid,vtidandprocnamecontexts. See theEnabling UST Events On Session LevelandAdding Contexts to Channels and Events of a Domainsections. Or if using the command-line:lttng enable-event -u -alttng add-context -u -t vpid -t vtid -t procname</li>
<li>lttng enable-event -u -a</li>
<li>lttng add-context -u -t vpid -t vtid -t procname</li>
<li>Preload theliblttng-ust-cyg-profilelibrary when running your program:LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/liblttng-ust-cyg-profile.so ./myprogram</li>
<li>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/liblttng-ust-cyg-profile.so ./myprogram</li>
<li>Recompile your application with "-g -finstrument-functions".</li>
<li>Set up a tracing session with the thevpid,vtidandprocnamecontexts. See theEnabling UST Events On Session LevelandAdding Contexts to Channels and Events of a Domainsections. Or if using the command-line:lttng enable-event -u -alttng add-context -u -t vpid -t vtid -t procname</li>

<li>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/liblttng-ust-cyg-profile.so ./myprogram</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you load the resulting trace, the Flame Chart View should be populated with
the relevant information.</p>
<p>Note that for non-trivial applications,liblttng-ust-cyg-profilegenerates alotof events! You may need to increase the channel's subbuffer size to
avoid lost events. Refer to theLTTng documentation.</p>
<p>For traces taken with LTTng-UST 2.8 or later, the Flame Chart View should show the
function names automatically, since it will make use of the debug information
statedump events (which are enabled when usingenable-event -u -a).</p>
<p>For traces taken with prior versions of UST, you would need to set the path to
the binary file or mapping manually:</p>
<h3 id="importing-a-binary-or-function-name-mapping-file-for-lttng-ust-28-traces"><a class="header" href="#importing-a-binary-or-function-name-mapping-file-for-lttng-ust-28-traces">Importing a binary or function name mapping file (for LTTng-UST &lt;2.8 traces)</a></h3>
<p>For LTTng-UST 2.8+, if it doesn't resolve symbols automatically, see theSource Lookup's Binary file location configuration.</p>
<p>If you followed the steps in the previous section, you should have a Flame Chart
View populated with function entries and exits. However, the view will display
the function addresses instead of names in the intervals, which are not very
useful by themselves. To get the actual function names, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click theConfigure how addresses are mapped to function names() button in the Flame Chart View.</li>
<li>Click theConfigure how addresses are mapped to function names() button in the Flame Chart View.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, multiple symbol providers can be available for a unique trace. Each symbol provider can be configured through its own tab. Thus, multiple sources can be used to map the function names to addresses. Below is an image of the basic symbol provider preference page which allows us to import binary or function name mapping files.</p>
<p>Simply click theAdd...button to add one or multiple mapping files. The mapping file could be one of two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>: a binary that was used for taking the trace.</li>
<li>: a binary that was used for taking the trace.</li>
<li>: a file generated from the binary usingnm myprogram &gt; mapping.txt. Select themapping.txtfile that was just created. If you are dealing with C++ executables, you may want to usenm --demangleinstead to get readable function names.</li>
<li>: a file generated from the binary usingnm myprogram &gt; mapping.txt. Select themapping.txtfile that was just created. If you are dealing with C++ executables, you may want to usenm --demangleinstead to get readable function names.</li>
</ul>
<p>The view should now update to display the function names instead. Make sure the
binary used for taking the trace is the one used for this step too (otherwise,
there is a good chance of the addresses not being the same).</p>
<p>Lastly, the basic symbol provider introduces the notion of priorities between the mapping files. The resolved symbols from the file at the top of the list will have a higher priority than the files listed below. The files can be moved using theUpandDownbuttons.</p>

<h2 id="flame-graph-view"><a class="header" href="#flame-graph-view">Flame Graph View</a></h2>
<p>This is an aggregate view of the function calls from theFlame Chart View. This shows a bird's eye view of what are the main
time sinks in the traced applications. Each entry in theFlame Graphrepresents an aggregation of all the calls to a function
in a certain depth of the call stack having the same caller. So, functions in theFlame Graphare aggregated by depth and
caller. This enables the user to find the most executed code path easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>In aFlame Graph, each entry (box) represents a function in the stack.</li>
<li>If one takes a single vertical line in the view, it represents a full call stack with parents calling children.</li>
<li>Thex-axisrepresents total duration (execution time) and not absolute time, so it is not aligned with the other views.</li>
<li>The width of an entry is the total time spent in that function, including time spent calling the children.</li>
<li>The total time can exceed the longest duration, if the program is pre-empted and not running during its trace time.</li>
<li>Each thread traced makes its own flame graph.</li>

</ul>
<p>The function name is visible on each Flame graph event if the size permits. Each box in theFlame Graphhas the same color as the box representing the same function in theFlame Chart.</p>
<p>To open this view, select a trace, expand it in theProject Explorer, then expand theCall Graph Analysis(the trace must be loaded) and open theFlame Graph.
It's also possible to go inWindow-&gt;Show View-&gt;Tracingthen
selectFlame Graphin the list.</p>
<p>To use theFlame graph, one can navigate it and find which function is consuming the most self-time.
This can be seen as a large plateau. Then the entry can be inspected. At this point, the worst offender in
terms of CPU usage will be highlighted, however, it is not a single call to investigate, but rather the
aggregation of all the calls. Right mouse-clicking on that entry will open a context sensitive menu.
SelectingGo to minimumorGo to maximumwill take the user to the minimum or maximum
recorded times in the trace. This is interesting to compare and contrast the two.</p>
<p>Hovering over a function will show a tooltip with the statistics on a per-function basis. One can see the total and self times
(worst-case,best-case,average,total time,standard deviation,number of calls) for that function.</p>
<p>If one wishes to explore at a medium detail level between the "classic" flame graph view and the call stack view, a per-thread flame
graph view is available by selecting the coarser menu and clicking onContent PresentationthenPer-thread. To return to
the default mode, return to that menu and click onAggregate Threads.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-a-flame-graph"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-a-flame-graph">How to use a Flame Graph</a></h3>
<p>Observing the time spent in each function can show where most of the time is spent and where one could optimize.
An example in the image above: one can see thatmp_sortis a recursive sort function, it takes approximately
40% of the execution time of the program. That means that perfectly parallelizing it can yield a gain of 20% for 2 threads, 33% for 3
and so forth. Looking at the functionprint_current_files, it takes about 30% of the time, and it has a childprint_many_per_linethat has a large
self time (above 10%). This could be another area that can be targeted for optimization. Knowing this in advance helps developers
know where to aim their efforts.</p>
<p>It is recommended to have a kernel trace as well as a user space trace in an experiment
while using theFlame Graphas it will show what is causing the largest delays.
When using theFlame Graphtogether with a call stack and a kernel trace,
an example work flow would be to find the worst offender in terms of time taken for a function
that seems to be taking too long. Then, using the context menuGo to maximum, one can navigate
to the maximum duration and see if the OS is, for example, preempting the function for too long,
or if the issue is in the code being executed.</p>
<h2 id="function-duration-statistics"><a class="header" href="#function-duration-statistics">Function Duration Statistics</a></h2>
<p>This displays the descriptive statistics of the 'wall time' durations of given functions. It gives an
overview of how often a function is called, how much total time it took, its mean duration as well as
its maximum, minimum times and the standard deviation.</p>
<p>If a time range is selected it will display the local statistics too.</p>

<h2 id="source-lookup-for-lttng-ust-28"><a class="header" href="#source-lookup-for-lttng-ust-28">Source Lookup (for LTTng-UST 2.8+)</a></h2>
<p>Starting with LTTng 2.8, the tracer can now provide enough information to
associate trace events with their location in the original source code.</p>
<p>To make use of this feature, first make sure your binaries are compiled with
debug information (-g), so that the instruction pointers can be mapped to source
code locations. This lookup is made using theaddr2lineandnmcommand-line utilities,
which need to be installed and on the$PATHof the system running Trace
Compass.addr2lineandnmare available in most Linux distributions, Mac OS X, Windows using Cygwin and others.</p>
<p>The following trace events need to be present in the trace:</p>
<ul>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:start</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:end</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:bin_info</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:build_id</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:start</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:end</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:bin_info</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:build_id</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as the following contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>vpid</li>
<li>ip</li>
<li>vpid</li>
<li>ip</li>
</ul>
<p>For ease of use, you can simply enable all the UST events when setting up your
session:</p>
<p>Note that you can also create and configure your session using theControl View.</p>
<p>If you want to track source locations in shared libraries loaded by the
application, you also need to enable the "lttng_ust_dl:*" events, as well
as preload the UST library providing them when running your program:</p>
<p>If all the required information is present, then theSource Locationcolumn
of the Event Table should be populated accordingly, and theOpen Source Codeaction should be available. Refer to the sectionEvent Source Lookupfor
more details.</p>
<p>TheBinary Locationinformation should be present even if the original
binaries are not available, since it only makes use of information found in the
trace. A+denotes a relative address (i.e. an offset within the object
itself), whereas a@denotes an absolute address, for
non-position-independent objects.</p>

<h3 id="binary-file-location-configuration"><a class="header" href="#binary-file-location-configuration">Binary file location configuration</a></h3>
<p>To resolve addresses to function names and source code locations, the analysis
makes use of the binary files (executables or shared libraries) present on the
system. By default, it will look for the file paths as they are found in the
trace, which means that it should work out-of-the-box if the trace was taken on
the same machine that Trace Compass is running.</p>
<p>It is possible to configure aroot directorythat will be used as a prefix
for all file path resolutions. The button to open the configuration dialog is
calledConfigure how addresses are mapped to function namesand is
currently located in theFlame Chart View. Note that the Call Stack View
will also make use of this configuration to resolve its function names.</p>
<p>The symbol configuration dialog for LTTng-UST 2.8+ traces</p>
<p>This can be useful if a trace was taken on a remote target, and an image of that
target is available locally.</p>
<p>If a binary file is being traced on a target, the paths in the trace will refer
to the paths on the target. For example, if they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>/usr/bin/program</li>
<li>/usr/lib/libsomething.so</li>
<li>/usr/local/lib/libcustom.so</li>
<li>/usr/bin/program</li>
<li>/usr/lib/libsomething.so</li>
<li>/usr/local/lib/libcustom.so</li>
</ul>
<p>and an image of that target is copied locally on the system at/home/user/project/image, which means the binaries above end up at:</p>
<ul>
<li>/home/user/project/image/usr/bin/program</li>
<li>/home/user/project/image/usr/lib/libsomething.so</li>
<li>/home/user/project/image/usr/local/lib/libcustom.so</li>
<li>/home/user/project/image/usr/bin/program</li>
<li>/home/user/project/image/usr/lib/libsomething.so</li>
<li>/home/user/project/image/usr/local/lib/libcustom.so</li>
</ul>
<p>Then selecting the/home/user/project/imagedirectory in the configuration
dialog above will allow Trace Compass to read the debug symbols correctly.</p>
<p>Note that this path prefix will apply to both binary file and source file
locations, which may or may not be desirable.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="flame-chart-view-1"><a class="header" href="#flame-chart-view-1">Flame Chart View</a></h2>
<p>The Flame Chart view allows the user to visualize the call stack per thread over time, if the application and trace provide this information.</p>
<p>To open this view go inWindow-&gt;Show View, if in the eclipse plug-in then clickOther...and selectTracing/Flame Chartin the list. The view shows the call stack information for the currently selected trace. Conversely, you can select a trace and expand it in theProject Explorerthen expandLTTng-UST CallStack Analysis(the trace must be loaded) and openFlame Chart.</p>
<p>The table on the left-hand side of the view shows the threads and call stack. The function name, depth, entry and exit time and duration are shown for the call stack at the selected time.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a function entry in the table will zoom the time graph to the selected function's range of execution.</p>
<p>The time graph on the right-hand side of the view shows the call stack state graphically over time. The function name is visible on each call stack event if size permits. The color of each call stack event is randomly assigned based on the function name, allowing for easy identification of repeated calls to the same function.</p>
<p>Clicking on the time graph will set the current time and consequently update the table with the current call stack information.</p>
<p>Shift-clicking on the time graph will select a time range. When the selection is a time range, the begin time is used to update the stack information.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a call stack event will zoom the time graph to the selected function's range of execution.</p>
<p>Clicking theSelect Next State ChangeorSelect Previous State Changeor using the left and right arrows will navigate to the next or previous call stack event, and select the function currently at the top of the call stack. Note that pressing theShiftkey at the same time will update the selection end time of the current selection.</p>
<p>Clicking theConfigure how addresses are mapped to function names() icon will open the symbol providers dialog. Depending on the available symbol providers for the given trace, you can specify: 1) a text or binary file containing mappings from function addresses to function names or 2) the root location of the binaries of the trace target. If the call stack provider for the current trace type only provides function addresses, a mapping file will be required to get the function names in the view. See the following sections for an example with LTTng-UST traces.</p>

<p>Once you load the resulting trace, the Flame Chart View should be populated with
the relevant information.</p>
<p>Note that for non-trivial applications,liblttng-ust-cyg-profilegenerates alotof events! You may need to increase the channel's subbuffer size to
avoid lost events. Refer to theLTTng documentation.</p>
<p>For traces taken with LTTng-UST 2.8 or later, the Flame Chart View should show the
function names automatically, since it will make use of the debug information
statedump events (which are enabled when usingenable-event -u -a).</p>
<p>For traces taken with prior versions of UST, you would need to set the path to
the binary file or mapping manually:</p>

<p>For LTTng-UST 2.8+, if it doesn't resolve symbols automatically, see theSource Lookup's Binary file location configuration.</p>
<p>If you followed the steps in the previous section, you should have a Flame Chart
View populated with function entries and exits. However, the view will display
the function addresses instead of names in the intervals, which are not very
useful by themselves. To get the actual function names, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click theConfigure how addresses are mapped to function names() button in the Flame Chart View.</li>
<li>Click theConfigure how addresses are mapped to function names() button in the Flame Chart View.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, multiple symbol providers can be available for a unique trace. Each symbol provider can be configured through its own tab. Thus, multiple sources can be used to map the function names to addresses. Below is an image of the basic symbol provider preference page which allows us to import binary or function name mapping files.</p>
<p>Simply click theAdd...button to add one or multiple mapping files. The mapping file could be one of two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>: a binary that was used for taking the trace.</li>
<li>: a binary that was used for taking the trace.</li>
<li>: a file generated from the binary usingnm myprogram &gt; mapping.txt. Select themapping.txtfile that was just created. If you are dealing with C++ executables, you may want to usenm --demangleinstead to get readable function names.</li>

</ul>
<p>The view should now update to display the function names instead. Make sure the
binary used for taking the trace is the one used for this step too (otherwise,
there is a good chance of the addresses not being the same).</p>
<p>Lastly, the basic symbol provider introduces the notion of priorities between the mapping files. The resolved symbols from the file at the top of the list will have a higher priority than the files listed below. The files can be moved using theUpandDownbuttons.</p>

<p>To use theFlame graph, one can navigate it and find which function is consuming the most self-time.
This can be seen as a large plateau. Then the entry can be inspected. At this point, the worst offender in
terms of CPU usage will be highlighted, however, it is not a single call to investigate, but rather the
aggregation of all the calls. Right mouse-clicking on that entry will open a context sensitive menu.
SelectingGo to minimumorGo to maximumwill take the user to the minimum or maximum
recorded times in the trace. This is interesting to compare and contrast the two.</p>
<p>Hovering over a function will show a tooltip with the statistics on a per-function basis. One can see the total and self times
(worst-case,best-case,average,total time,standard deviation,number of calls) for that function.</p>

<p>Observing the time spent in each function can show where most of the time is spent and where one could optimize.
An example in the image above: one can see thatmp_sortis a recursive sort function, it takes approximately
40% of the execution time of the program. That means that perfectly parallelizing it can yield a gain of 20% for 2 threads, 33% for 3
and so forth. Looking at the functionprint_current_files, it takes about 30% of the time, and it has a childprint_many_per_linethat has a large
self time (above 10%). This could be another area that can be targeted for optimization. Knowing this in advance helps developers
know where to aim their efforts.</p>
<p>It is recommended to have a kernel trace as well as a user space trace in an experiment
while using theFlame Graphas it will show what is causing the largest delays.
When using theFlame Graphtogether with a call stack and a kernel trace,
an example work flow would be to find the worst offender in terms of time taken for a function
that seems to be taking too long. Then, using the context menuGo to maximum, one can navigate
to the maximum duration and see if the OS is, for example, preempting the function for too long,

<p>Starting with LTTng 2.8, the tracer can now provide enough information to
associate trace events with their location in the original source code.</p>
<p>To make use of this feature, first make sure your binaries are compiled with
debug information (-g), so that the instruction pointers can be mapped to source
code locations. This lookup is made using theaddr2lineandnmcommand-line utilities,
which need to be installed and on the$PATHof the system running Trace
Compass.addr2lineandnmare available in most Linux distributions, Mac OS X, Windows using Cygwin and others.</p>
<p>The following trace events need to be present in the trace:</p>
<ul>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:start</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:end</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:bin_info</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:build_id</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:start</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:end</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:bin_info</li>
<li>lttng_ust_statedump:build_id</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as the following contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>vpid</li>
<li>ip</li>
<li>vpid</li>
<li>ip</li>
</ul>
<p>For ease of use, you can simply enable all the UST events when setting up your
session:</p>
<p>Note that you can also create and configure your session using theControl View.</p>
<p>If you want to track source locations in shared libraries loaded by the
application, you also need to enable the "lttng_ust_dl:*" events, as well
as preload the UST library providing them when running your program:</p>
<p>If all the required information is present, then theSource Locationcolumn
of the Event Table should be populated accordingly, and theOpen Source Codeaction should be available. Refer to the sectionEvent Source Lookupfor
more details.</p>
<p>TheBinary Locationinformation should be present even if the original
binaries are not available, since it only makes use of information found in the
trace. A+denotes a relative address (i.e. an offset within the object
itself), whereas a@denotes an absolute address, for
non-position-independent objects.</p>

<h3 id="binary-file-location-configuration-1"><a class="header" href="#binary-file-location-configuration-1">Binary file location configuration</a></h3>
<p>To resolve addresses to function names and source code locations, the analysis
makes use of the binary files (executables or shared libraries) present on the
system. By default, it will look for the file paths as they are found in the
trace, which means that it should work out-of-the-box if the trace was taken on
the same machine that Trace Compass is running.</p>
<p>It is possible to configure aroot directorythat will be used as a prefix
for all file path resolutions. The button to open the configuration dialog is
calledConfigure how addresses are mapped to function namesand is
currently located in theFlame Chart View. Note that the Call Stack View
will also make use of this configuration to resolve its function names.</p>

<p>This can be useful if a trace was taken on a remote target, and an image of that
target is available locally.</p>
<p>If a binary file is being traced on a target, the paths in the trace will refer

<ul>
<li>/usr/bin/program</li>

<li>/home/user/project/image/usr/local/lib/libcustom.so</li>
</ul>
<p>Then selecting the/home/user/project/imagedirectory in the configuration

<p>The state system is a component of TMF which can track the states of different elements of the system over the duration of a trace. To build this state system, events have to go chronologically through a state provider, which defines what changes are caused by the event to the system.</p>
<p>The state system obtained by the state provider can then be used to populate data-driven views without having to re-read the trace, or to query specific timestamps in the trace without needing to access the trace file.</p>
<h3 id="definitions-and-example"><a class="header" href="#definitions-and-example">Definitions and example</a></h3>
<p>Before we start, we'll define a few terms used in the following sections. The interested reader should read theTmf Developer Guidefor more complete description of the state system and state providers.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we'll use an example trace with the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>start(number): A new task with ID 'number' just started.</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): The task with ID 'number' is executing a critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>wait(number): The task with ID 'number' cannot execute a critical section and needs to wait for it.</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): A task finished executing the critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>stop(number): The task with ID 'number' has just finished.</li>
<li>start(number): A new task with ID 'number' just started.</li>

<li>wait(number): The task with ID 'number' cannot execute a critical section and needs to wait for it.</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): A task finished executing the critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>stop(number): The task with ID 'number' has just finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="determining-the-state-system-structure"><a class="header" href="#determining-the-state-system-structure">Determining the state system structure</a></h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to determine the attribute tree we'll use to represent the model of the system. The attribute tree is like a file system with directories and files, where files are logically gathered in the same parent directory. There is no one good way to build a tree, the logic will depend on the situation and on the person defining it.</p>
<p>The generated state system may be used later on to populate views, so attributes of the tree could be grouped in such a way as to make it easy to reach them with a simple path. The view will then be more simple.</p>
<p>In our example case, we'll want to track the status of each task and, for each critical section, which task is running them.</p>
<p>Then we determine how each event will affect the state of the attributes. But first, let's ask ourselves what values should each state take.</p>
<p>Let's see with the tree:</p>
<p>Then we determine how each event will affect the state of the attributes. In the attribute paths below, elements in {} are values coming from the trace event, while strings are constants. For the sake of simplicity, we'll say "update attribute", but if an attribute does not exist, it will be created.</p>
<ul>
<li>start(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "RUNNING".</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "CRITICAL" and Update attribute "Critical section/{fct_name}" to "{number}".</li>
<li>wait(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "WAITING".</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{valueOf Critical section/{fct_name}}" to RUNNING and update "Critical section/{fct_name}" to null.</li>
<li>stop(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to null.</li>
<li>start(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "RUNNING".</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "CRITICAL" and Update attribute "Critical section/{fct_name}" to "{number}".</li>
<li>wait(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "WAITING".</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{valueOf Critical section/{fct_name}}" to RUNNING and update "Critical section/{fct_name}" to null.</li>
<li>stop(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to null.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing-the-xml-state-provider"><a class="header" href="#writing-the-xml-state-provider">Writing the XML state provider</a></h3>
<p>Once the model is done at a high level, it is time to translate it to an XML data-driven analysis. For details on how to use each XML element, refer to the documentation available in the XSD files. Some elements will be commented on below.</p>
<p>First define the state provider element.</p>
<p>The "version" attribute indicates which version of the state system is defined here. Once a state provider has been defined for a trace type, it will typically be used by a team of people and it may be modified over time. This version number should be bumped each time a new version of the state provider is published. This will force a rebuild of any existing state histories (if applicable) whose version number is different from the current one.</p>
<p>The "id" attribute uniquely identifies this state provider, and the analysis that will contain it.</p>
<p>Optional header information can be added to the state provider. A "traceType" should be defined to tell TMF which trace type this analysis will apply to. If no tracetype is specified, the analysis will appear under every trace. A "label" can optionally be added to have a more user-friendly name for the analysis.</p>
<p>If predefined values will be used in the state provider, they must be defined before the state providers. They can then be referred to in the state changes by name, preceded by the '$' sign. It is not necessary to use predefined values, the state change can use values like (100, 101, 102) directly.</p>
<p>The following event handler shows what to do with the event namedstart. It causes one state change. The sequence ofstateAttributeelements represents the path to the attribute in the attribute tree, each element being one level of the tree. ThestateValueindicates which value to assign to the attribute at the given path. The "$RUNNING" value means it will use the predefined value named RUNNING above.</p>
<p>Suppose the actual event isstart(3). The result of this state change is that at the time of the event, the state system attribute "Tasks/3" will have value 100.</p>
<p>The full XML file for the example above would look like this:</p>
<h3 id="debugging-the-xml-state-provider"><a class="header" href="#debugging-the-xml-state-provider">Debugging the XML state provider</a></h3>
<p>To debug the state system that was generated by the XML state provider, one could use theState System Explorer View, along with the events editor. By selecting an event, you can see what changes this event caused and the states of other attributes at the time.</p>
<p>If there are corrections to make, you may modify the XML state provider file, and re-import it. To re-run the analysis, you must first delete the supplementary files by right-clicking on your trace, and selectingDelete supplementary files.... Check your analysis' .ht file, so that the analysis will be run again when the trace is reopened. The supplementary file deletion will have closed the trace, so it needs to be opened again to use the newly imported analysis file.</p>
<p>If modifications are made to the XML state provider after it has been "published", theversionattribute of thexmlStateProviderelement should be updated. This avoids having to delete each trace's supplementary file manually. If the saved state system used a previous version, it will automatically be rebuilt from the XML file.</p>
<h2 id="defining-an-xml-pattern-provider"><a class="header" href="#defining-an-xml-pattern-provider">Defining an XML pattern provider</a></h2>
<p>There are patterns within a trace that can provide high level details about the system execution. Apatternis a particular combination of events or states that are expected to occur within a trace. It may be composed of several state machines that inherit or communicate through a common state system.</p>
<p>We may have multiple instances (scenarios) of a running state machine within a pattern. Each scenario which has its own path in the state system can generate segments to populate the data-driven views</p>
<h3 id="the-state-system-structure"><a class="header" href="#the-state-system-structure">The state system structure</a></h3>
<p>The pattern analysis generates a predefined attribute tree described as follows:</p>
<p>The user can add custom data in this tree or determine its own attribute tree beside of this one.</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-xml-pattern-provider"><a class="header" href="#writing-the-xml-pattern-provider">Writing the XML pattern provider</a></h3>
<p>Details about the XML structure are available in the XSD files.</p>
<p>First define the pattern element. As the state provider element described inWriting the XML state provider, it has a "version" attribute and an "id" attribute.</p>
<p>Optional header information as well as predefined values like described inWriting the XML state providercan be added.</p>
<p>Stored values can be added before the pattern handler. The predefined actionsaveStoredFieldtriggers the updates of the stored fields and the predefined actionclearStoredFieldsreset the values.</p>
<p>Theidof the stored field is used as the field name in the event. If the field is not available, a null value will be saved for it. Thealiasis the name by which this field will be accessible in the state system.</p>
<p>The behavior of the pattern and the models it needs are described in the pattern handler element.</p>
<p>The structure of the state machine (FSM) is based on the SCXML structure. The following example describe an FSM that matches all the system call in an LTTng kernel trace.</p>
<p>The value of thetargetattribute corresponds to the 'id' of a state in the same FSM. Similarly, the value of theactionattribute corresponds to the 'id' of an action element described in the XML file and is a reference to it. Multiple actions can be executed by separating their names by ':', likeaction1:action2</p>
<p>Conditions are used in the transitions to switch between the state of an FSM. They can be specified by setting thecondattribute in the transition and they correspond to atestelement. Two types of conditions are allowed:Data conditionandTime condition. It is possible to combine several conditions using a logical operator (OR, AND, ...).</p>
<p>Data conditions tests the ongoing event information against the data in the state system or constant values. The following condition tests whether the current thread of the event is also the ongoing scenario thread.</p>
<p>Two types of time conditions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time range conditions test whether the ongoing event happens between a specific range of time. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens between 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Time range conditions test whether the ongoing event happens between a specific range of time. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens between 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Elapsed time conditions tests the value of the time spent since a specific state of an fsm. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens less than 3 nanoseconds after that the scenario reaches the state "syscall_entry_x".</li>
<li>Elapsed time conditions tests the value of the time spent since a specific state of an fsm. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens less than 3 nanoseconds after that the scenario reaches the state "syscall_entry_x".</li>
</ul>
<p>Two types of actions are allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>State changes update values of attributes into the state system. The following example set the value of the thread for the current scenario.</li>

<p>Here is the complete XML file by combining all the examples models above:</p>
<p>Here is an another example of XML analysis that creates a segment for each event read based on a field namedtestField:</p>
<p>Here is the associated trace:</p>
<p>This will produce 4 segments described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 1, end time = 10;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 3, end time = 100;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 5, end time = 20;</li>

<li>name=seg1, start time = 5, end time = 20;</li>

</ul>

<p>A time graph view is a view divided in two, with a tree viewer on the left showing information on the different entries to display and a Gantt-like viewer on the right, showing the state of the entries over time. TheControl Flow Viewis an example of a time graph view.</p>
<p>Such views can be defined in XML using the data in the state system. The state system itself could have been built by an XML-defined state provider or by any predefined Java analysis. It only requires knowing the structure of the state system, which can be explored using theState System Explorer View(or programmatically using the methods inITmfStateSystem).</p>
<p>In the example above, suppose we want to display the status for each task. In the state system, it means the path of the entries to display is "Tasks/*". The attribute whose value should be shown in the Gantt chart is the entry attribute itself. So the XML to display these entries would be as such:</p>
<p>But first, the view has to be declared. It has an ID, to uniquely identify this view among all the available XML files.</p>
<p>Optional header information can be added to the view.analysiselements will associate the view only to the analysis identified by the "id" attribute. It can be either the ID of the state provider, like in this case, or the analysis ID of any analysis defined in Java. If no analysis is specified, the view will appear under every analysis with a state system. Thelabelelement allows to give a more user-friendly name to the view. The label does not have to be unique. As long as the ID is unique, views for different analyses can use the same name.</p>
<p>Also, if the values of the attributes to display are known, they can be defined, along with a text to explain them and a color to draw them with. Note that the values are the same as defined in the state provider, but the name does not have to be the same. While in the state provider, a simple constant string makes sense to use in state changes. But in the view, the name will appear in the legend, so a user-friendly text is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Here is the full XML for the time graph view:</p>

<p>We will use the Linux Kernel Analysis on LTTng kernel traces to show an example XY chart. In this state system, the status of each CPU is a numerical value. We will display this value as the Y axis of the series. There will be one series per CPU. The XML to display these entries would be as such:</p>

<p>To define XML components, you need to create a new XML file and use the XSD that comes with the XML plugin.</p>
<p>For now, the XSD is only available through the source code in org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlDefinition.xsd.</p>

<p>The state system is a component of TMF which can track the states of different elements of the system over the duration of a trace. To build this state system, events have to go chronologically through a state provider, which defines what changes are caused by the event to the system.</p>
<p>The state system obtained by the state provider can then be used to populate data-driven views without having to re-read the trace, or to query specific timestamps in the trace without needing to access the trace file.</p>
<h3 id="definitions-and-example-1"><a class="header" href="#definitions-and-example-1">Definitions and example</a></h3>
<p>Before we start, we'll define a few terms used in the following sections. The interested reader should read theTmf Developer Guidefor more complete description of the state system and state providers.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we'll use an example trace with the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>start(number): A new task with ID 'number' just started.</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): The task with ID 'number' is executing a critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>wait(number): The task with ID 'number' cannot execute a critical section and needs to wait for it.</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): A task finished executing the critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>

<li>exec_end(fct_name): A task finished executing the critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>stop(number): The task with ID 'number' has just finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="determining-the-state-system-structure-1"><a class="header" href="#determining-the-state-system-structure-1">Determining the state system structure</a></h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to determine the attribute tree we'll use to represent the model of the system. The attribute tree is like a file system with directories and files, where files are logically gathered in the same parent directory. There is no one good way to build a tree, the logic will depend on the situation and on the person defining it.</p>
<p>The generated state system may be used later on to populate views, so attributes of the tree could be grouped in such a way as to make it easy to reach them with a simple path. The view will then be more simple.</p>
<p>In our example case, we'll want to track the status of each task and, for each critical section, which task is running them.</p>
<p>Then we determine how each event will affect the state of the attributes. But first, let's ask ourselves what values should each state take.</p>
<p>Let's see with the tree:</p>
<p>Then we determine how each event will affect the state of the attributes. In the attribute paths below, elements in {} are values coming from the trace event, while strings are constants. For the sake of simplicity, we'll say "update attribute", but if an attribute does not exist, it will be created.</p>
<ul>
<li>start(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "RUNNING".</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "CRITICAL" and Update attribute "Critical section/{fct_name}" to "{number}".</li>
<li>wait(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "WAITING".</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{valueOf Critical section/{fct_name}}" to RUNNING and update "Critical section/{fct_name}" to null.</li>
<li>stop(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to null.</li>
<li>start(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "RUNNING".</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "CRITICAL" and Update attribute "Critical section/{fct_name}" to "{number}".</li>
<li>wait(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "WAITING".</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{valueOf Critical section/{fct_name}}" to RUNNING and update "Critical section/{fct_name}" to null.</li>
<li>stop(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to null.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing-the-xml-state-provider-1"><a class="header" href="#writing-the-xml-state-provider-1">Writing the XML state provider</a></h3>
<p>Once the model is done at a high level, it is time to translate it to an XML data-driven analysis. For details on how to use each XML element, refer to the documentation available in the XSD files. Some elements will be commented on below.</p>
<p>First define the state provider element.</p>
<p>The "version" attribute indicates which version of the state system is defined here. Once a state provider has been defined for a trace type, it will typically be used by a team of people and it may be modified over time. This version number should be bumped each time a new version of the state provider is published. This will force a rebuild of any existing state histories (if applicable) whose version number is different from the current one.</p>
<p>The "id" attribute uniquely identifies this state provider, and the analysis that will contain it.</p>
<p>Optional header information can be added to the state provider. A "traceType" should be defined to tell TMF which trace type this analysis will apply to. If no tracetype is specified, the analysis will appear under every trace. A "label" can optionally be added to have a more user-friendly name for the analysis.</p>
<p>If predefined values will be used in the state provider, they must be defined before the state providers. They can then be referred to in the state changes by name, preceded by the '$' sign. It is not necessary to use predefined values, the state change can use values like (100, 101, 102) directly.</p>
<p>The following event handler shows what to do with the event namedstart. It causes one state change. The sequence ofstateAttributeelements represents the path to the attribute in the attribute tree, each element being one level of the tree. ThestateValueindicates which value to assign to the attribute at the given path. The "$RUNNING" value means it will use the predefined value named RUNNING above.</p>
<p>Suppose the actual event isstart(3). The result of this state change is that at the time of the event, the state system attribute "Tasks/3" will have value 100.</p>
<p>The full XML file for the example above would look like this:</p>
<h3 id="debugging-the-xml-state-provider-1"><a class="header" href="#debugging-the-xml-state-provider-1">Debugging the XML state provider</a></h3>
<p>To debug the state system that was generated by the XML state provider, one could use theState System Explorer View, along with the events editor. By selecting an event, you can see what changes this event caused and the states of other attributes at the time.</p>
<p>If there are corrections to make, you may modify the XML state provider file, and re-import it. To re-run the analysis, you must first delete the supplementary files by right-clicking on your trace, and selectingDelete supplementary files.... Check your analysis' .ht file, so that the analysis will be run again when the trace is reopened. The supplementary file deletion will have closed the trace, so it needs to be opened again to use the newly imported analysis file.</p>
<p>If modifications are made to the XML state provider after it has been "published", theversionattribute of thexmlStateProviderelement should be updated. This avoids having to delete each trace's supplementary file manually. If the saved state system used a previous version, it will automatically be rebuilt from the XML file.</p>

<p>There are patterns within a trace that can provide high level details about the system execution. Apatternis a particular combination of events or states that are expected to occur within a trace. It may be composed of several state machines that inherit or communicate through a common state system.</p>
<p>We may have multiple instances (scenarios) of a running state machine within a pattern. Each scenario which has its own path in the state system can generate segments to populate the data-driven views</p>
<h3 id="the-state-system-structure-1"><a class="header" href="#the-state-system-structure-1">The state system structure</a></h3>

<h3 id="writing-the-xml-pattern-provider-1"><a class="header" href="#writing-the-xml-pattern-provider-1">Writing the XML pattern provider</a></h3>
<p>Details about the XML structure are available in the XSD files.</p>
<p>First define the pattern element. As the state provider element described inWriting the XML state provider, it has a "version" attribute and an "id" attribute.</p>
<p>Optional header information as well as predefined values like described inWriting the XML state providercan be added.</p>
<p>Stored values can be added before the pattern handler. The predefined actionsaveStoredFieldtriggers the updates of the stored fields and the predefined actionclearStoredFieldsreset the values.</p>
<p>Theidof the stored field is used as the field name in the event. If the field is not available, a null value will be saved for it. Thealiasis the name by which this field will be accessible in the state system.</p>
<p>The behavior of the pattern and the models it needs are described in the pattern handler element.</p>
<p>The structure of the state machine (FSM) is based on the SCXML structure. The following example describe an FSM that matches all the system call in an LTTng kernel trace.</p>
<p>The value of thetargetattribute corresponds to the 'id' of a state in the same FSM. Similarly, the value of theactionattribute corresponds to the 'id' of an action element described in the XML file and is a reference to it. Multiple actions can be executed by separating their names by ':', likeaction1:action2</p>
<p>Conditions are used in the transitions to switch between the state of an FSM. They can be specified by setting thecondattribute in the transition and they correspond to atestelement. Two types of conditions are allowed:Data conditionandTime condition. It is possible to combine several conditions using a logical operator (OR, AND, ...).</p>
<p>Data conditions tests the ongoing event information against the data in the state system or constant values. The following condition tests whether the current thread of the event is also the ongoing scenario thread.</p>
<p>Two types of time conditions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time range conditions test whether the ongoing event happens between a specific range of time. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens between 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Time range conditions test whether the ongoing event happens between a specific range of time. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens between 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Elapsed time conditions tests the value of the time spent since a specific state of an fsm. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens less than 3 nanoseconds after that the scenario reaches the state "syscall_entry_x".</li>
<li>Elapsed time conditions tests the value of the time spent since a specific state of an fsm. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens less than 3 nanoseconds after that the scenario reaches the state "syscall_entry_x".</li>
</ul>
<p>Two types of actions are allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>State changes update values of attributes into the state system. The following example set the value of the thread for the current scenario.</li>

<p>Conditions are used in the transitions to switch between the state of an FSM. They can be specified by setting thecondattribute in the transition and they correspond to atestelement. Two types of conditions are allowed:Data conditionandTime condition. It is possible to combine several conditions using a logical operator (OR, AND, ...).</p>
<p>Data conditions tests the ongoing event information against the data in the state system or constant values. The following condition tests whether the current thread of the event is also the ongoing scenario thread.</p>
<p>Two types of time conditions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time range conditions test whether the ongoing event happens between a specific range of time. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens between 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Time range conditions test whether the ongoing event happens between a specific range of time. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens between 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Elapsed time conditions tests the value of the time spent since a specific state of an fsm. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens less than 3 nanoseconds after that the scenario reaches the state "syscall_entry_x".</li>
<li>Elapsed time conditions tests the value of the time spent since a specific state of an fsm. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens less than 3 nanoseconds after that the scenario reaches the state "syscall_entry_x".</li>

<p>Two types of actions are allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>State changes update values of attributes into the state system. The following example set the value of the thread for the current scenario.</li>

<p>A time graph view is a view divided in two, with a tree viewer on the left showing information on the different entries to display and a Gantt-like viewer on the right, showing the state of the entries over time. TheControl Flow Viewis an example of a time graph view.</p>
<p>Such views can be defined in XML using the data in the state system. The state system itself could have been built by an XML-defined state provider or by any predefined Java analysis. It only requires knowing the structure of the state system, which can be explored using theState System Explorer View(or programmatically using the methods inITmfStateSystem).</p>
<p>In the example above, suppose we want to display the status for each task. In the state system, it means the path of the entries to display is "Tasks/*". The attribute whose value should be shown in the Gantt chart is the entry attribute itself. So the XML to display these entries would be as such:</p>
<p>But first, the view has to be declared. It has an ID, to uniquely identify this view among all the available XML files.</p>
<p>Optional header information can be added to the view.analysiselements will associate the view only to the analysis identified by the "id" attribute. It can be either the ID of the state provider, like in this case, or the analysis ID of any analysis defined in Java. If no analysis is specified, the view will appear under every analysis with a state system. Thelabelelement allows to give a more user-friendly name to the view. The label does not have to be unique. As long as the ID is unique, views for different analyses can use the same name.</p>
<p>Also, if the values of the attributes to display are known, they can be defined, along with a text to explain them and a color to draw them with. Note that the values are the same as defined in the state provider, but the name does not have to be the same. While in the state provider, a simple constant string makes sense to use in state changes. But in the view, the name will appear in the legend, so a user-friendly text is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Here is the full XML for the time graph view:</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the result of the preceding example on a test trace. The trace used, as well as the XML file are availablehere.</p>

<p>We will use the Linux Kernel Analysis on LTTng kernel traces to show an example XY chart. In this state system, the status of each CPU is a numerical value. We will display this value as the Y axis of the series. There will be one series per CPU. The XML to display these entries would be as such:</p>

<p>TheCounters Viewallows the user to inspect the values of hardware performance counters during the trace's lifetime. The counters store data concerning hardware-related activities such as page faults. The Counters View is currently available for LTTng UST and kernel traces.
The Counters View supports experiments.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-lttng-trace-with-performance-counters"><a class="header" href="#creating-an-lttng-trace-with-performance-counters">Creating an LTTng trace with performance counters</a></h2>
<p>For the Counters View to display any data, the trace needs to collect information related to performance counters. There are two ways to configure a trace for this type of logging. On the command line, add a new context field to an LTTng channel using thelttng-add-contextcommand (for more information, refer to theLTTng documentation). On the LTTng Tracer Control, add a new context field using the ''Add Context..." window (seeAdding Contexts to Channels and Events of a Domain).</p>
<h2 id="counters-view"><a class="header" href="#counters-view">Counters View</a></h2>
<p>To open the view, double-click on theCounterstree element of theProject Exploreror type "Counters" in theQuick Accesssearch bar.</p>
<p>The Counters View contains a filtered checkbox tree on the left-hand side and a chart on the right-hand side. The checkbox tree also contains aLegendcolumn whose purpose is to display the styling of the entry in the chart. Thus, when checking a tree element, its data will appear in the chart and its styling will appear next to the element. An entry will conserve the same styling whether it is displayed on the chart or not.</p>
<p>The counters data can also be visualized cumulatively throughout time thanks to thetool bar button.
By default the view is displayed differentially, with each data point's value being the counter value at that point's timestamp minus that of the previous point's timestamp.</p>
<p>The view's checkbox tree has enhanced functionalities. First, the checkboxes have three visual states. They are determined according to the visible elements of the tree.</p>
<ul>
<li>The entry is not checked.- The entry is checked, but not all of its children.- The entry and all of its children are checked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the checkbox tree has a search bar which allows users to apply filters on the tree elements. Multiple filters need to be separated with the "/" symbol. A match is detected when the subsequence of a tree element matches the pattern entered by the user. When checking an element of a filtered tree, the check state is only propagated to the visible elements. Below are different examples of filters being applied to the same tree:</p>

<p>Trace Compass contains some Java Utility Logging (JUL) tracepoints in various places in the code. To diagnose issues with Trace Compass or when reporting problems with the application, a JUL trace may be useful to help pinpoint the problem. The following sections explain how to enable JUL logging in Trace Compass and use various handlers to handle the data.</p>
<h2 id="enable-jul-logging"><a class="header" href="#enable-jul-logging">Enable JUL Logging</a></h2>
<p>By default, all the logging of the Trace Compass namespace is disabled. To enable it, one needs to add the following property to thevmargs:-Dorg.eclipse.tracecompass.logging=true.</p>
<p>The log levels and components can be controlled via a configuration file whose path is specified also in thevmargslike this:-Djava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/logger.properties. An example configuration file can be found in the next section.</p>
<p>If running the RCP, these arguments can be appended at the end of thetracecompass.inifile located in the folder where the executable is located. If running from Eclipse in development mode, in theRun configurations..., the arguments should be added in theArgumentstab in theVM argsbox.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-jul-logging"><a class="header" href="#configuring-jul-logging">Configuring JUL logging</a></h2>
<p>JUL logging can be fine-tuned to log only specific components, specific levels, but also to different log handlers, with different formats, etc. Or else, the default level is INFO and the default log handler is a ConsoleHandler which displays all log message to the Console, which can be quite cumbersome.</p>
<p>Here is an examplelogger.propertiesfile to control what is being logged and where.</p>
<h2 id="lttng-jul-log-handler"><a class="header" href="#lttng-jul-log-handler">LTTng JUL log handler</a></h2>
<p>The various log handlers have an overhead on the application. The ConsoleHandler has a visible impact on Trace Compass performance. The FileHandler also has an overhead though less visible, but when logging from multiple threads at the same time, the file becomes a bottleneck, so that logging data cannot be used with accuracy for performance analysis. TheLTTng log handleris much better in a multi-threads context.</p>
<p>LTTng-UST comes with the Java JUL agent in most distros. Otherwise, it is possible to manually compile lttng-ust with options--enable-java-agent-juland install it.</p>
<p>The necessary classes for the java agent will have been installed on the system. Since Equinox (the OSGi implementation used by Eclipse and thus Trace Compass) uses its own classpath and ignores any classpath entered on the command line for security reasons, one needs to specify the agent class path with the bootclasspath argument:</p>
<p>Note that unlike the -classpath argument, -Xbootsclasspath does not follow the dependencies specified by a jar's Manifest, thus it is required to list both the -jul and the -common jars here.</p>
<p>These classes need to load the LTTng JNI library. Because they were loaded from the boot class path by the boot ClassLoader, the library path entered on the command line is ignored. A workaround is to manually copy the library to the jvm's main library path. For example</p>
<p>Or to overwrite the JVM's library path with the following VM argument.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: this last method overwrites the main java library path. It may have unknown side-effects. None were found yet.</p>
<p>LTTng can now be used as a handler for Trace Compass's JUL, by adding the following line to the logger.properties file</p>
<p>The tracepoints will be those logged by a previously defined configuration file. Here is how to setup LTTng to handle JUL logging:</p>

<p>LTTng is a tracer, it will give an enormous amount of information about the system it is running on. This means it can solve many types of problems.</p>
<p>The following are examples of problems that can be solved with a tracer.</p>
<h2 id="random-stutters"><a class="header" href="#random-stutters">Random stutters</a></h2>
<p>Bob is running a computer program and it stutters periodically every 2 minutes. The CPU load is relatively low and Bob isn't running low on RAM.</p>
<p>He decides to trace his complete system for 10 minutes. He opens the LTTng view in eclipse. From the control, he creates a session and enables all kernel tracepoints.</p>
<p>He now has a 10 GB trace file. He imports the trace to his viewer and loads it up.</p>
<p>A cursory look at the histogram bar on the bottom show relatively even event distribution, there are no interesting spikes, so he will have to dig deeper to find the issue. If he had seen a spike every 2 minutes, there would be strong chances this would be the first thing to investigate as it would imply a lot of kernel activity at the same period as his glitch, this would have been a path to investigate.</p>
<p>As Bob suspects that he may be having some hardware raising IRQs or some other hardware based issue and adding delays. He looks at the ressource view and doesn't see anything abnormal.</p>
<p>Bob did note an exact second one glitch occurred: 11:58:03. He zooms into the time range or 11:58:02-11:58:04 using the histogram. He is happy to see the time is human readable local wall clock time and no longer in "nanseconds since the last reboot".In the resource view, once again, he sees many soft irqs being raised at the same time, around the time his GUI would freeze. He changes views and looks at the control flow view at that time and sees a process spending a lot of time in the kernel: FooMonitor- his temperature monitoring software.</p>
<p>At this point he closes FooMonitor and notices the bug disappeared. He could call it a day but he wants to see what was causing the system to freeze. He cannot justify closing a piece of software without understanding the issue. It may be a conflict that HIS software is causing after all.</p>
<p>The system freezes around the time this program is running. He clicks on the process in the control flow view and looks at the corresponding events in the detailed events view. He sees: open - read - close repeated hundreds of times on the same file. The file being read was /dev/HWmonitor. He sends a report to the FooMonitor team and warns his team that FooMonitor was glitching their performance.</p>
<p>The FooMonitor team finds that they were calling a system bus call that would halt a CPU while reading the temperature so that the core would not induce an 0.1 degree error in the reading, by disabling this feature, they improve their software and stop the glitches from occurring on their custommer's machine. They also optimize their code to open the file read and clone it once.</p>

<p>Alice is running her server. She noticed that one of her nodes was slowing down, and wasn't sure why, upon reading the trace she noticed that her time between a block request and complete was around 10ms.</p>
<p>This is abnormal, normally her server handles IOs in under 100us, since they are quite local.</p>
<p>She walks up to the server and hears the hard drive thrashing, This prompts her to look up in the events view the sectors being read in the block complete requests. There are her requests interleaved with other ones at the opposite side of the hard drive.</p>
<p>She sees the tracer writing but there is another process that is writing to the server disk non stop. She looks in the control flow view and sees that there's a program from another fellow engineer, "Wally" that is writing in his home in a loop "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.".</p>
<p>Alice kills the program, and immediately the server speeds up. She then goes to discuss this with Wally and implements strict hard disk quotas on the server.</p>

<p>Bob is running a computer program and it stutters periodically every 2 minutes. The CPU load is relatively low and Bob isn't running low on RAM.</p>
<p>He decides to trace his complete system for 10 minutes. He opens the LTTng view in eclipse. From the control, he creates a session and enables all kernel tracepoints.</p>
<p>He now has a 10 GB trace file. He imports the trace to his viewer and loads it up.</p>
<p>A cursory look at the histogram bar on the bottom show relatively even event distribution, there are no interesting spikes, so he will have to dig deeper to find the issue. If he had seen a spike every 2 minutes, there would be strong chances this would be the first thing to investigate as it would imply a lot of kernel activity at the same period as his glitch, this would have been a path to investigate.</p>
<p>As Bob suspects that he may be having some hardware raising IRQs or some other hardware based issue and adding delays. He looks at the ressource view and doesn't see anything abnormal.</p>
<p>Bob did note an exact second one glitch occurred: 11:58:03. He zooms into the time range or 11:58:02-11:58:04 using the histogram. He is happy to see the time is human readable local wall clock time and no longer in "nanseconds since the last reboot".In the resource view, once again, he sees many soft irqs being raised at the same time, around the time his GUI would freeze. He changes views and looks at the control flow view at that time and sees a process spending a lot of time in the kernel: FooMonitor- his temperature monitoring software.</p>
<p>At this point he closes FooMonitor and notices the bug disappeared. He could call it a day but he wants to see what was causing the system to freeze. He cannot justify closing a piece of software without understanding the issue. It may be a conflict that HIS software is causing after all.</p>
<p>The system freezes around the time this program is running. He clicks on the process in the control flow view and looks at the corresponding events in the detailed events view. He sees: open - read - close repeated hundreds of times on the same file. The file being read was /dev/HWmonitor. He sends a report to the FooMonitor team and warns his team that FooMonitor was glitching their performance.</p>
<p>The FooMonitor team finds that they were calling a system bus call that would halt a CPU while reading the temperature so that the core would not induce an 0.1 degree error in the reading, by disabling this feature, they improve their software and stop the glitches from occurring on their custommer's machine. They also optimize their code to open the file read and clone it once.</p>

<p>Historically, LTTng was developed to trace the Linux kernel and, over time, a number of kernel-oriented analysis views were developed and organized in a perspective.</p>
<p>This section presents a description of theOS Tracing Overviewperspective and theLTTng Kernelperspective.</p>
<h2 id="os-tracing-overview-perspective"><a class="header" href="#os-tracing-overview-perspective">OS Tracing Overview Perspective</a></h2>
<p>TheOS Tracing Overviewperspective groups the following views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Explorer View</li>
<li>Events Editor</li>
<li>Histogram View</li>
<li>CPU Usage View</li>
<li>Disk I/O Activity View</li>
<li>Kernel Memory Usage View</li>
<li>Project Explorer View</li>
<li>Events Editor</li>
<li>Histogram View</li>
<li>CPU Usage View</li>
<li>Disk I/O Activity View</li>
<li>Kernel Memory Usage View</li>
</ul>
<p>The perspective can be opened from the Eclipse Open Perspective dialog (Window &gt; Open Perspective... &gt; Other).</p>
<p>This perspective is intended to be used to locate performance issues by observing resource usage.</p>
<p>The perspective can show times resource usage is anomalous. This can help locating the causes of system slowdowns in throughput or response time.</p>
<p>An example can be program that is doing a lot of processing then slows down due to a database access. The user will see a dip in CPU usage and maybe a slight rise in I/O access. The user should consider both spike and slums to be an indication of an area worth investigating.</p>
<p>Once a performance issue has been localized, it can be further investigated with the #LTTng kernel Perspective.</p>
<h2 id="lttng-kernel-perspective"><a class="header" href="#lttng-kernel-perspective">LTTng Kernel Perspective</a></h2>
<p>TheLTTng Kernelperspective is built upon theTracing Perspective, re-organizes them slightly and adds the following views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control Flow View- to visualize processes state transitions</li>
<li>Resources View- to visualize system resources state transitions</li>
<li>LTTng Tracer Control- to configure LTTng tracing sessions remotely</li>
<li>Control Flow View- to visualize processes state transitions</li>
<li>Resources View- to visualize system resources state transitions</li>
<li>LTTng Tracer Control- to configure LTTng tracing sessions remotely</li>
</ul>
<p>The perspective can be opened from the Eclipse Open Perspective dialog (Window &gt; Open Perspective... &gt; Other).</p>
<h2 id="control-flow-view"><a class="header" href="#control-flow-view">Control Flow View</a></h2>
<p>TheControl Flowview is a LTTng-specific view that shows per-process events graphically. The Linux Kernel Analysis is executed the first time a LTTng Kernel is opened. After opening the trace, the elementControl Flowis added under theLinux Kernel Analysistree element in the Project Explorer. To open the view,  double-click theControl Flowtree element.</p>
<p>Alternatively, selectControl FlowunderLTTngwithin theShow Viewwindow (Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...):</p>
<p>You should get something like this:</p>
<p>The view is divided into the following important sections:process tree and information,control flowand thetoolbar. The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>The following sections provide detailed information for each part of the Control Flow View.</p>
<h3 id="process-tree-and-information"><a class="header" href="#process-tree-and-information">Process tree and information</a></h3>
<p>Processes are organized as a tree within this view. This way, child and parent processes are easy to identify.</p>
<p>The layout is based on the states computed from the trace events.</p>
<p>A given process may be shown at different places within the tree since the nodes areunique (TID, birth time) couples. This means that if process B of parent A dies, you'll still see it in the tree. If process A forks process B again, it will be shown as a different node since it won't have the same birth time (and probably not the same TID). This has the advantage that the tree, once loaded, never changes: horizontal scrolling within thecontrol flowremains possible.</p>
<p>The TID column shows the process node'sthread IDand the PTID column shows itsparent thread ID(nothing is shown if the process has no parent).</p>
<p>It is possible to sort the columns of the tree by clicking on the column header. Subsequent clicking will change the sort order. The hierarchy, i.e. the parent-child relationship is kept. When opening a trace for the first time, the processes are sorted bybirth time. The sort order and column will be preserved when switching between open traces. Note that when opening an experiment the processes will be sorted within each trace.</p>
<h3 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control flow</a></h3>
<p>This part of the Control Flow View is probably the most interesting one. Using the mouse, you can navigate through the trace (go left, right) and zoom on a specific region to inspect its details.</p>
<p>The colored bars you see representstatesfor the associated process node. When a process state changes in time, so does the color. For stateSYSCALLthe name of the system call is displayed in the state bar. States colors legend is available through atoolbar button:</p>
<p>The style can be updated in the legend.</p>
<p>This dark yellow is what you'll see most of the time since scheduling puts processes on hold while others run.</p>
<p>The vertical blue line with T1 above it is thecurrent selection indicator. When a time range is selected, the region between the begin and end time of the selection will be shaded and two lines with T1 and T2 above will be displayed. The time stamps corresponding to T1, T2 and their delta are shown in the status line when the mouse is hovering over the control flow.</p>
<p>Arrows can be displayed that follow the execution of each CPU across processes. The arrows indicate when the scheduler switches from one process to another for a given CPU. The CPU being followed is indicated on the state tooltip. When the scheduler switches to and from the idle process, the arrow skips to the next process which executes on the CPU after the idle process. Note that an appropriate zoom level is required for all arrows to be displayed.</p>
<p>The display of arrows is optional and can be toggled using theHide Arrowstoolbar button. It is also possible to follow a CPU's execution across state changes and the scheduler's process switching using theFollow CPU Forward/Backwardtoolbar buttons.</p>
<h4 id="using-the-mouse"><a class="header" href="#using-the-mouse">Using the mouse</a></h4>
<p>The following mouse actions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>left-click: select a time or time range begin time</li>
<li>Shift-left-click or drag: Extend or shrink the selection range</li>
<li>left-click: select a time or time range begin time</li>
<li>Shift-left-click or drag: Extend or shrink the selection range</li>
<li>left-drag horizontally: select a time range or change the time range begin or end time</li>
<li>middle-drag or Ctrl-left-drag: pan horizontally and/or vertically</li>
<li>right-drag horizontally:zoom region</li>
<li>click on a colored bar: the associated process node is selected and the current time indicator is moved where the click happened</li>
<li>mouse wheel up/down: scroll up or down</li>
<li>Shift-mouse wheel up/down: scroll left or right</li>
<li>Ctrl-mouse wheel up/down: zoom in or out horizontally</li>
<li>Shift-Ctrl-mouse wheel up/down: zoom in or out vertically</li>
<li>drag the time ruler horizontally: zoom in or out with fixed start time</li>

<li>drag the time ruler horizontally: zoom in or out with fixed start time</li>
<li>double-click the time ruler: reset zoom to full range</li>
</ul>
<p>When the current time indicator is changed (when clicking in the states flow), all the other views aresynchronized. For example, theEvents Editorwill show the event matching the current time indicator. The reverse behaviour is also implemented: selecting an event within the Events View will update the Control Flow View current time indicator.</p>

<h2 id="resources-view"><a class="header" href="#resources-view">Resources View</a></h2>
<p>This view is specific to LTTng kernel traces.  The Linux Kernel Analysis is executed the first time a LTTng Kernel is opened. After opening the trace, the elementResourcesis added under theLinux Kernel Analysistree element of the Project Explorer. To open the view, double-click theResourcestree element.</p>
<p>Alternatively, go inWindow-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...and selectLTTng/Resourcesin the list.</p>
<p>This view shows the state of system resources i.e. if changes occurred during the trace either onCPUs,IRQsorsoft IRQs, it will appear in this view. The left side of the view present a list of resources that are affected by at least one event of the trace. The right side illustrate the state in which each resource is at some point in time. For stateUSERMODEit also prints the process name in the state bar. For stateSYSCALLthe name of the system call is
displayed in the state region.</p>
<p>When anIRQis handled by aCPU, its states are shown under the correspondingCPUentry. Similarly, theCPUthat was handling anIRQis shown under the handledIRQ. Therefore, the trace can be visualized from aCPUpoint of view or from anIRQpoint of view.</p>
<p>Just like other views, according to which trace points and system calls are activated, the content of this view may change from one trace to another.</p>
<p>The time axis is aligned with other views that support automatic time axis alignment (seeAutomatic Time Axis Alignment).</p>
<p>Each state are represented by one color so it is faster to say what is happening.</p>
<p>The style can be updated in the legend.</p>
<p>To go through the state of a resource, you first have to select the resource and the timestamp that interest you. For the latter, you can pick some time before the interesting part of the trace.</p>
<p>Then, by selectingNext Event, it will show the next state transition and the event that occurred at this time.</p>

<h2 id="process-wait-analysis"><a class="header" href="#process-wait-analysis">Process Wait Analysis</a></h2>
<p>TraceCompass can recover wait causes of local and distributed processes using operating system events. The analysis highlights the tasks and devices causing wait. Wait cause recovery is recursive, comprise all tasks running on the system and works across computers using packet trace synchronization.</p>
<p>The analysis details are available in the paperWait analysis of distributed systems using kernel tracing.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h3>
<p>The analysis requires a Linux kernel trace. Additional instrumentation may be required for specific kernel version and for distributed tracing. This instrumentation is available inLTTng modules addonson GitHub.</p>
<p>The required events are:</p>
<ul>
<li>sched_switch, sched_wakeup: Scheduling events indicate when a process is blocked and the wake-up event indicates the task or resource that unblocked the task. For kernel versions comprised between 3.8 and 4.1, the eventsched_ttwu(which stands for Try To Wake-Up) is provided for backward compatibility in LTTng modules addons.</li>
<li>IRQ, SoftIRQ and IPI: Interrupt events are required to distinguish the context of the wake-up. When a wake-up occurs inside an interrupt handler, it must be associated with the device causing the interrupt and not the interrupted task. For that reason, interrupt entry and exit events are required.</li>
<li>inet_sock_local_in, inet_sock_local_out: The network events record a subset of TCP/IP packet header using a netfilter hook in the kernel. The send and receive events are matched to show the communication between distributed processes. Network events are mandatory for analyzing wait in TCP/IP programs, whether they are executing locally or on different computers. They also used to synchronize traces recorded on multiple computers. For further details, refer to theTrace synchronizationsection.</li>

<p>To analyze a distributed program, all computers involved in the processing must be traced simultaneously. The LTTng Tracer Control of TraceCompass can trace a remote computer, but controlling simultaneous tracing is not supported at the moment, meaning that all sessions must be started separately and interactively. TraceCompass will support this feature in the future. For now, it is suggested to uselttng-clustercommand line tool to control simultaneous tracing sessions on multiple computers. This tool is based onFabricand uses SSH to start the tracing sessions, execute a workload, stop the sessions and gather traces on the local computer. For more information, refer to the lttng-cluster documentation.</p>
<p>We use theDjango traceas an example to demonstrate the wait analysis.Djangois a popular Web framework. The application is theDjango Poll app tutorial. The traces were recorded on three computers, namely the client (implemented with Python Mechanize), the Web server (Apache with WSGI) and the database server (PostgreSQL). The client simulates a vote in the poll.</p>
<h3 id="running-the-analysis"><a class="header" href="#running-the-analysis">Running the analysis</a></h3>
<p>To open all three traces simultaneously, we first create an experiment containing these traces and then synchronize the traces, such that they have a common time base. Then, the analysis is done by selecting a task in theControl Flow View. The result is displayed in theCritical Flow View, which works like theControl Flow View. The steps to load the Django example follows.</p>

<p>TheScheduler wake up/Scheduler switch Latency Analysismeasures the latency between the sched_wakeup (scheduler wake up) and sched_switch (scheduler switch) event. In layman's terms, the analysis measures the time from the moment a process/thread wakes up until it is switched onto the CPU. The durations are visualized using theLatencyviews. For more information about theLatencyviews see chapterLatency Analyses.</p>
<p>Besides the typical latency views, the analysis also provides a Priority/Thread name Statistics view. The view groups latencies using thread names and priorities, and provides statistics for these groups.</p>

<p>It is possible to define custom trace analyses and a way to view them in an XML format. These kind of analyses allow doing more with the trace data than what the default analyses shipped with TMF offer. It can be customized to a specific problem, and fine-tuned to show exactly what you're looking for.</p>
<h2 id="managing-xml-files-containing-analyses"><a class="header" href="#managing-xml-files-containing-analyses">Managing XML files containing analyses</a></h2>
<p>TheManage XML Analysespreference page is used to manage the list of XML files containing analyses. To open the preference page, selectWindow &gt; Preferencesfrom the main menu bar, then click onXML Analysesunder theTracingsection.

<p>To define XML components, you need to create a new XML file and use the XSD that comes with the XML plugin.</p>
<p>For now, the XSD is only available through the source code in org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlDefinition.xsd.</p>

<h2 id="defining-an-xml-state-provider"><a class="header" href="#defining-an-xml-state-provider">Defining an XML state provider</a></h2>
<p>The state system is a component of TMF which can track the states of different elements of the system over the duration of a trace. To build this state system, events have to go chronologically through a state provider, which defines what changes are caused by the event to the system.</p>
<p>The state system obtained by the state provider can then be used to populate data-driven views without having to re-read the trace, or to query specific timestamps in the trace without needing to access the trace file.</p>
<h3 id="definitions-and-example"><a class="header" href="#definitions-and-example">Definitions and example</a></h3>
<p>Before we start, we'll define a few terms used in the following sections. The interested reader should read theTmf Developer Guidefor more complete description of the state system and state providers.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we'll use an example trace with the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>start(number): A new task with ID 'number' just started.</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): The task with ID 'number' is executing a critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>wait(number): The task with ID 'number' cannot execute a critical section and needs to wait for it.</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): A task finished executing the critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>stop(number): The task with ID 'number' has just finished.</li>
<li>start(number): A new task with ID 'number' just started.</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): The task with ID 'number' is executing a critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>wait(number): The task with ID 'number' cannot execute a critical section and needs to wait for it.</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): A task finished executing the critical section named 'fct_name'.</li>
<li>stop(number): The task with ID 'number' has just finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="determining-the-state-system-structure"><a class="header" href="#determining-the-state-system-structure">Determining the state system structure</a></h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to determine the attribute tree we'll use to represent the model of the system. The attribute tree is like a file system with directories and files, where files are logically gathered in the same parent directory. There is no one good way to build a tree, the logic will depend on the situation and on the person defining it.</p>
<p>The generated state system may be used later on to populate views, so attributes of the tree could be grouped in such a way as to make it easy to reach them with a simple path. The view will then be more simple.</p>
<p>In our example case, we'll want to track the status of each task and, for each critical section, which task is running them.</p>
<p>Then we determine how each event will affect the state of the attributes. But first, let's ask ourselves what values should each state take.</p>
<p>Let's see with the tree:</p>
<p>Then we determine how each event will affect the state of the attributes. In the attribute paths below, elements in {} are values coming from the trace event, while strings are constants. For the sake of simplicity, we'll say "update attribute", but if an attribute does not exist, it will be created.</p>
<ul>
<li>start(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "RUNNING".</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "CRITICAL" and Update attribute "Critical section/{fct_name}" to "{number}".</li>
<li>wait(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "WAITING".</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{valueOf Critical section/{fct_name}}" to RUNNING and update "Critical section/{fct_name}" to null.</li>
<li>stop(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to null.</li>
<li>start(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "RUNNING".</li>
<li>execute(number, fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "CRITICAL" and Update attribute "Critical section/{fct_name}" to "{number}".</li>
<li>wait(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to "WAITING".</li>
<li>exec_end(fct_name): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{valueOf Critical section/{fct_name}}" to RUNNING and update "Critical section/{fct_name}" to null.</li>
<li>stop(number): Update state value of attribute "Tasks/{number}" to null.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing-the-xml-state-provider"><a class="header" href="#writing-the-xml-state-provider">Writing the XML state provider</a></h3>
<p>Once the model is done at a high level, it is time to translate it to an XML data-driven analysis. For details on how to use each XML element, refer to the documentation available in the XSD files. Some elements will be commented on below.</p>
<p>First define the state provider element.</p>
<p>The "version" attribute indicates which version of the state system is defined here. Once a state provider has been defined for a trace type, it will typically be used by a team of people and it may be modified over time. This version number should be bumped each time a new version of the state provider is published. This will force a rebuild of any existing state histories (if applicable) whose version number is different from the current one.</p>
<p>The "id" attribute uniquely identifies this state provider, and the analysis that will contain it.</p>
<p>Optional header information can be added to the state provider. A "traceType" should be defined to tell TMF which trace type this analysis will apply to. If no tracetype is specified, the analysis will appear under every trace. A "label" can optionally be added to have a more user-friendly name for the analysis.</p>
<p>If predefined values will be used in the state provider, they must be defined before the state providers. They can then be referred to in the state changes by name, preceded by the '$' sign. It is not necessary to use predefined values, the state change can use values like (100, 101, 102) directly.</p>
<p>The following event handler shows what to do with the event namedstart. It causes one state change. The sequence ofstateAttributeelements represents the path to the attribute in the attribute tree, each element being one level of the tree. ThestateValueindicates which value to assign to the attribute at the given path. The "$RUNNING" value means it will use the predefined value named RUNNING above.</p>
<p>Suppose the actual event isstart(3). The result of this state change is that at the time of the event, the state system attribute "Tasks/3" will have value 100.</p>
<p>The full XML file for the example above would look like this:</p>
<h3 id="debugging-the-xml-state-provider"><a class="header" href="#debugging-the-xml-state-provider">Debugging the XML state provider</a></h3>
<p>To debug the state system that was generated by the XML state provider, one could use theState System Explorer View, along with the events editor. By selecting an event, you can see what changes this event caused and the states of other attributes at the time.</p>
<p>If there are corrections to make, you may modify the XML state provider file, and re-import it. To re-run the analysis, you must first delete the supplementary files by right-clicking on your trace, and selectingDelete supplementary files.... Check your analysis' .ht file, so that the analysis will be run again when the trace is reopened. The supplementary file deletion will have closed the trace, so it needs to be opened again to use the newly imported analysis file.</p>
<p>If modifications are made to the XML state provider after it has been "published", theversionattribute of thexmlStateProviderelement should be updated. This avoids having to delete each trace's supplementary file manually. If the saved state system used a previous version, it will automatically be rebuilt from the XML file.</p>
<h2 id="defining-an-xml-pattern-provider"><a class="header" href="#defining-an-xml-pattern-provider">Defining an XML pattern provider</a></h2>
<p>There are patterns within a trace that can provide high level details about the system execution. Apatternis a particular combination of events or states that are expected to occur within a trace. It may be composed of several state machines that inherit or communicate through a common state system.</p>
<p>We may have multiple instances (scenarios) of a running state machine within a pattern. Each scenario which has its own path in the state system can generate segments to populate the data-driven views</p>
<h3 id="the-state-system-structure"><a class="header" href="#the-state-system-structure">The state system structure</a></h3>
<p>The pattern analysis generates a predefined attribute tree described as follows:</p>
<p>The user can add custom data in this tree or determine its own attribute tree beside of this one.</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-xml-pattern-provider"><a class="header" href="#writing-the-xml-pattern-provider">Writing the XML pattern provider</a></h3>
<p>Details about the XML structure are available in the XSD files.</p>
<p>First define the pattern element. As the state provider element described inWriting the XML state provider, it has a "version" attribute and an "id" attribute.</p>
<p>Optional header information as well as predefined values like described inWriting the XML state providercan be added.</p>
<p>Stored values can be added before the pattern handler. The predefined actionsaveStoredFieldtriggers the updates of the stored fields and the predefined actionclearStoredFieldsreset the values.</p>
<p>Theidof the stored field is used as the field name in the event. If the field is not available, a null value will be saved for it. Thealiasis the name by which this field will be accessible in the state system.</p>
<p>The behavior of the pattern and the models it needs are described in the pattern handler element.</p>
<p>The structure of the state machine (FSM) is based on the SCXML structure. The following example describe an FSM that matches all the system call in an LTTng kernel trace.</p>
<p>The value of thetargetattribute corresponds to the 'id' of a state in the same FSM. Similarly, the value of theactionattribute corresponds to the 'id' of an action element described in the XML file and is a reference to it. Multiple actions can be executed by separating their names by ':', likeaction1:action2</p>
<p>Conditions are used in the transitions to switch between the state of an FSM. They can be specified by setting thecondattribute in the transition and they correspond to atestelement. Two types of conditions are allowed:Data conditionandTime condition. It is possible to combine several conditions using a logical operator (OR, AND, ...).</p>
<p>Data conditions tests the ongoing event information against the data in the state system or constant values. The following condition tests whether the current thread of the event is also the ongoing scenario thread.</p>
<p>Two types of time conditions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time range conditions test whether the ongoing event happens between a specific range of time. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens between 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Time range conditions test whether the ongoing event happens between a specific range of time. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens between 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Elapsed time conditions tests the value of the time spent since a specific state of an fsm. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens less than 3 nanoseconds after that the scenario reaches the state "syscall_entry_x".</li>
<li>Elapsed time conditions tests the value of the time spent since a specific state of an fsm. The following condition tests whether the ongoing event happens less than 3 nanoseconds after that the scenario reaches the state "syscall_entry_x".</li>
</ul>
<p>Two types of actions are allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>State changes update values of attributes into the state system. The following example set the value of the thread for the current scenario.</li>

<li>Generate segments. The following example represents a system call segment.</li>
<li>Generate segments. The following example represents a system call segment.</li>
</ul>
<p>When existing, the stored fields will be added as fields for the generated segments.</p>
<p>Here is the complete XML file by combining all the examples models above:</p>
<p>Here is an another example of XML analysis that creates a segment for each event read based on a field namedtestField:</p>
<p>Here is the associated trace:</p>
<p>This will produce 4 segments described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 1, end time = 10;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 3, end time = 100;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 5, end time = 20;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 7, end time = 200;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 1, end time = 10;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 3, end time = 100;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 5, end time = 20;</li>
<li>name=seg1, start time = 7, end time = 200;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="defining-an-xml-time-graph-view"><a class="header" href="#defining-an-xml-time-graph-view">Defining an XML time graph view</a></h2>
<p>A time graph view is a view divided in two, with a tree viewer on the left showing information on the different entries to display and a Gantt-like viewer on the right, showing the state of the entries over time. TheControl Flow Viewis an example of a time graph view.</p>
<p>Such views can be defined in XML using the data in the state system. The state system itself could have been built by an XML-defined state provider or by any predefined Java analysis. It only requires knowing the structure of the state system, which can be explored using theState System Explorer View(or programmatically using the methods inITmfStateSystem).</p>
<p>In the example above, suppose we want to display the status for each task. In the state system, it means the path of the entries to display is "Tasks/*". The attribute whose value should be shown in the Gantt chart is the entry attribute itself. So the XML to display these entries would be as such:</p>
<p>But first, the view has to be declared. It has an ID, to uniquely identify this view among all the available XML files.</p>
<p>Optional header information can be added to the view.analysiselements will associate the view only to the analysis identified by the "id" attribute. It can be either the ID of the state provider, like in this case, or the analysis ID of any analysis defined in Java. If no analysis is specified, the view will appear under every analysis with a state system. Thelabelelement allows to give a more user-friendly name to the view. The label does not have to be unique. As long as the ID is unique, views for different analyses can use the same name.</p>
<p>Also, if the values of the attributes to display are known, they can be defined, along with a text to explain them and a color to draw them with. Note that the values are the same as defined in the state provider, but the name does not have to be the same. While in the state provider, a simple constant string makes sense to use in state changes. But in the view, the name will appear in the legend, so a user-friendly text is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Here is the full XML for the time graph view:</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the result of the preceding example on a test trace. The trace used, as well as the XML file are availablehere.</p>
<h4 id="using-the-keyboard"><a class="header" href="#using-the-keyboard">Using the keyboard</a></h4>

<h2 id="defining-an-xml-xy-chart"><a class="header" href="#defining-an-xml-xy-chart">Defining an XML XY chart</a></h2>
<p>An XY chart displays series as a set of numerical values over time. The X-axis represents the time and is synchronized with the trace's current time range. The Y-axis can be any numerical value.</p>
<p>Such views can be defined in XML using the data in the state system. The state system itself could have been built by an XML-defined state provider or by any predefined Java analysis. It only requires knowing the structure of the state system, which can be explored using theState System Explorer View(or programmatically using the methods inITmfStateSystem).</p>
<p>We will use the Linux Kernel Analysis on LTTng kernel traces to show an example XY chart. In this state system, the status of each CPU is a numerical value. We will display this value as the Y axis of the series. There will be one series per CPU. The XML to display these entries would be as such:</p>
<p>But first, the view has to be declared. It has an ID, to uniquely identify this view among all the available XML files.</p>
<p>Like for the time graph views, optional header information can be added to the view.analysiselements will associate the view only to the analysis identified by the "id" attribute. It can be either the ID of the state provider, like in this case, or the analysis ID of any analysis defined in Java. If no analysis is specified, the view will appear under every analysis with a state system. Thelabelelement allows to give a more user-friendly name to the view. The label does not have to be unique. As long as the ID is unique, views for different analyses can use the same name.</p>

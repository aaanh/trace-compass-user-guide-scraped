## Basic mode

If the time offset to apply is known, it can be applied directly to the trace. In theProject Explorerview, select a trace, right-click and selectApply Time Offset.... It is also possible to select multiple traces, experiments or trace folders. All contained traces will be selected.



The dialog opens, inBasicmode.



Enter a time offset to apply in theOffset in secondscolumn, with or without decimals. Then press theOKbutton.



The time offset is applied to the trace and can be seen in thetime offsetproperty in thePropertiesview when the trace is selected.

The applied time offset is added to any time offset or time transformation formula currently set for the trace, and the resulting offset replaces any previous setting.

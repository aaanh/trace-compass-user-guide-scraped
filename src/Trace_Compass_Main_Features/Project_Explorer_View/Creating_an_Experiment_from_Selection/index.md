### Creating an Experiment from Selection

An experiment can be quickly created and opened automatically by selecting one or more traces and/or trace folders in theProject Explorerview, and then selecting theOpen as Experiment...context menu. A sub-menu with the available experiment types is opened. Select the desired experiment type from the sub-menu. All selected traces and traces recursively found in selected trace folders will be added to the experiment.

If a single trace or trace folder is selected, its name will be used for the experiment, otherwise a default name will be used, possibly appended with a number to avoid name clashes.

If an experiment with the same name and traces already exists, it will be reopened (or selected if it is already opened). Otherwise, a new experiment will be created and opened.

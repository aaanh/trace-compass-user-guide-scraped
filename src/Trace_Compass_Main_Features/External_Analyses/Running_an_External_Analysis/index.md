### Running an External Analysis

To run an external analysis:
- Import a trace to the project.
- Make sure the trace is opened by double-clicking its name in theProject Explorer View.
- Under the trace in theProject Explorer View, expandExternal Analysesto view the list of available external analyses.The external analyses which are either missing or not compatible with the trace are stroke and cannot be executed.

- Optional: If you want the external analysis to analyze a specific time range of the current trace, make a time range selection.You can use views like theHistogram Viewand theControl Flow View(if it's available for this trace) to make a time range selection.External analyses are executed on the current time range selection if there is one, or on the whole trace otherwise.

- Right-click the external analysis to run and clickRun External Analysis.


- In the openedExternal Analysis Parameterswindow, optionally enter extra parameters to pass to the program.


- ClickOKto start the analysis.

- ClickOKto start the analysis.

Note that many external analyses can be started concurrently.

When the external analysis is done analyzing, its results are saved as areportin Trace Compass. The tables contained in this report are also automatically opened into a new report view when the analysis is finished.

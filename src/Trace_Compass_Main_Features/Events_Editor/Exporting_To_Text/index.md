### Exporting To Text

It is possible to export the content of the trace to a text file based on the columns displayed in the events table. If a filter (seeFiltering) was defined prior exporting only events that match the filter will be exported to the file. To export the trace to text, press the right mouse button on the events table. A context-sensitive menu will show. Select theExport To Text...menu option. A file locater dialog will open. Fill in the file name and location and then press onOK. A window with a progress bar will open till the export is finished.

Note: The columns in the text file are separated by tabs.

## Scheduler wake up/Scheduler switch Latency Analysis

TheScheduler wake up/Scheduler switch Latency Analysismeasures the latency between the sched_wakeup (scheduler wake up) and sched_switch (scheduler switch) event. In layman's terms, the analysis measures the time from the moment a process/thread wakes up until it is switched onto the CPU. The durations are visualized using theLatencyviews. For more information about theLatencyviews see chapterLatency Analyses.

Besides the typical latency views, the analysis also provides a Priority/Thread name Statistics view. The view groups latencies using thread names and priorities, and provides statistics for these groups.

##### Show Active Threads Only

The Show Active Threads Only filter allow a user to increase the signal to noise ratio by filtering out allinactivethreads.

A thread is considered inactive when it is in the following state:
- non-existing
- unknown
- wait and blocked
- wait and unknown
- non-existing
- unknown
- wait and blocked
- wait and unknown

A user can fine tune this filter by providing ranges of CPUs allowing the filter to only show active thread running on the specified CPUs.

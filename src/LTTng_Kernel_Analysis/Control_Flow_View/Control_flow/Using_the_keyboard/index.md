WASD Navigation

Use WASD Navigation in conjunction with the mouse, where one hand changes the mouse
			position and the other hand uses the keyboard shortcuts to zoom or scroll.
- W: Zoom-in horizontally centered to the mouse position
- S: Zoom-out horizontally centered to the mouse position
- A: Scroll left by a quarter of the current window range
- D: Scroll right by a quarter of the current window range
- W: Zoom-in horizontally centered to the mouse position
- S: Zoom-out horizontally centered to the mouse position
- A: Scroll left by a quarter of the current window range
- D: Scroll right by a quarter of the current window range

When the mouse cursor is over entries (left pane):
- -: Collapse selected entry
- +: Expand selected entry
- *: Expand selected entry to the level with at least one collapsed entry
- -: Collapse selected entry
- +: Expand selected entry
- *: Expand selected entry to the level with at least one collapsed entry

Please note that the behavior of some shortcuts can slightly differ based on the operating system.

When the selection indicators are changed, all the other views aresynchronized. For example, theEvents Editorwill show the event matching the current time indicator. The reverse behaviour is also implemented: selecting an event within the Events View will update the Control Flow View current time indicator.

### Marker Axis

The marker axis is visible only when at least one marker category with markers for the current trace is shown.

The marker axis displays one row per marker category. Each marker's time range and/or label (if applicable) are drawn on the marker axis.

Clicking on any marker's time range or label will set the current time selection to the marker's time or time range. Shift-clicking will extend the current time selection to include the marker's time or time range.

Clicking on the "X" icon to the left of the marker category name will hide this marker category from the time graph. It can be shown again using the correspondingShow Markersmenu item in the view menu.

The marker axis can be collapsed and expanded by clicking on the icon at the top left of the marker axis. The marker axis can be completely removed by hiding all available marker categories.

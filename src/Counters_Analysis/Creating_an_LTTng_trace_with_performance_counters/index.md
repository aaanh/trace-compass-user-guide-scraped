## Creating an LTTng trace with performance counters

For the Counters View to display any data, the trace needs to collect information related to performance counters. There are two ways to configure a trace for this type of logging. On the command line, add a new context field to an LTTng channel using thelttng-add-contextcommand (for more information, refer to theLTTng documentation). On the LTTng Tracer Control, add a new context field using the ''Add Context..." window (seeAdding Contexts to Channels and Events of a Domain).

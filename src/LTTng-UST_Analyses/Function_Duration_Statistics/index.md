## Function Duration Statistics

This displays the descriptive statistics of the 'wall time' durations of given functions. It gives an
			overview of how often a function is called, how much total time it took, its mean duration as well as
			its maximum, minimum times and the standard deviation.

If a time range is selected it will display the local statistics too.

This analysis is available if theFlame Graphis available.

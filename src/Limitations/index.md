# Limitations
- When parsing text traces, the timestamps are assumed to be in the local time zone. This means that when combining it to CTF binary traces, there could be offsets by a few hours depending on where the traces were taken and where they were read.
- LTTng Tools v2.1.0 introduced the command line options--no-consumerand--disable-consumerfor session creation as well as the commandsenable-consumeranddisable-consumer. The LTTng Tracer Control in Eclipse doesn't support these options and commands because they will obsolete in LTTng Tools v2.2.0 and because the procedure for session creation offers already all relevant advanced parameters.

### Adding Contexts to All Events of a Channel

Adding contexts on channels and events from the channel level, will enable the specified contexts to all events of the selected channel. To add contexts on the channel level, select a channel, click right mouse button on a channel tree node and select the menu itemAdd Context...from the context-sensitive menu.



A new display will open for selecting one or more contexts to add. Select one or more contexts as described in chapterAdding Contexts to Channels and Events of a Domain. Upon successful operation, the selected context will be added to all channels and their events of the selected domain.Notethat the LTTng 2.0 tracer control on the remote host doesn't provide a way to retrieve added contexts. Hence it's not possible to display the context information in the GUI.

## Installation Verification

If you do not have any traces, sample LTTng traces can be found herehttp://lttng.org/files/samples. This page contains links to some sample LTTng 2.0 kernel traces. The trace needs to be uncompressed to be opened. The traces can also be imported directly as archive, see theImportingsection for more detail.

Here are the quick steps to verify that your installation is functional using a LTTng trace:
